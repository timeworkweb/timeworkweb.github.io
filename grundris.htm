<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0><I>Contradiction between the foundation of bourgeois
production </I>(value as measure) <I>and its development. Machines etc.
</I>The exchange of living labour for objectified labour -- i.e. the positing
of social labour in the form of the contradiction of capital and wage labour
-- is the ultimate development of the <I>value-relation </I>and of production
resting on value. Its presupposition is -- and remains -- the mass of direct
labour time, the quantity of labour employed, as the determinant factor
in the production of wealth. But to the degree that large industry develops,
the creation of real wealth comes to depend less on labour time and on
the amount of labour employed than on the power of the agencies set in
motion during labour time, whose 'powerful effectiveness' is</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>itself in turn out of all proportion to the direct
labour time spent on their production, but depends rather on the general
state of science and on the progress of technology, or the application
of this science to production. (The development of this science, especially
natural science, and all others with the latter, is itself in turn related
to the development of material production.) Agriculture, e.g., becomes
merely the application of the science of material metabolism, its regulation
for the greatest advantage of the entire body of society. Real wealth manifests
itself, rather -- and large industry reveals this -- in the monstrous disproportion
between the labour time applied, and its product, as well as in the qualitative
imbalance between labour, reduced to a pure abstraction, and the power
of the production process it superintends. Labour no longer appears so
much to be included within the production process; rather, the human being
comes to relate more as watchman and regulator to the production process
itself. (What holds for machinery holds likewise for the combination of
human activities and the development of human intercourse.) No longer does
the worker insert a modified natural thing [<I>Naturgegenstand</I>] as
middle link between the object [<I>Objekt</I>] and himself; rather, he
inserts the process of nature, transformed into an industrial process,
as a means between himself and inorganic nature, mastering it. He steps
to the side of the production process instead of being its chief actor.
In this transformation, it is neither the direct human labour he himself
performs, nor the time during which he works, but rather the appropriation
of his own general productive power, his understanding of nature and his
mastery over it by virtue of his presence as a social body -- it is, in
a word, the development of the social individual which appears as the great
foundation-stone of production and of wealth. </FONT></B></P>

<P><A NAME="disposable"></A><B><FONT SIZE=+0>The <I>theft of alien labour
time, on which the present wealth is based, </I>appears a miserable foundation
in face of this new one, created by large-scale industry itself. As soon
as labour in the direct form has ceased to be the great well-spring of
wealth, labour time ceases and must cease to be its measure, and hence
exchange value [must cease to be the measure] of use value. The <I>surplus
labour of the mass </I>has ceased to be the condition for the development
of general wealth, just as the <I>non-labour of the few, </I>for the development
of the general powers of the human head. With that, production based on
exchange value breaks down, and the direct, material production process
is stripped of the form of</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>penury and antithesis. The free development of individualities,
and hence not the reduction of necessary labour time so as to posit surplus
labour, but rather the general <A NAME="126"></A>reduction of the necessary
labour of society to a minimum, which then corresponds to the artistic,
scientific etc. development of the individuals in the time set free, and
with the means created, for all of them. <A NAME="125"></A>Capital itself
is the moving contradiction, [in] that it presses to reduce labour time
to a minimum, while it posits labour time, on the other side, as sole measure
and source of wealth. Hence it diminishes labour time in the necessary
form so as to increase it in the superfluous form; hence posits the superfluous
in growing measure as a condition -- question of life or death -- for the
necessary. On the one side, then, it calls to life all the powers of science
and of nature, as of social combination and of social intercourse, in order
to make the creation of wealth independent (relatively) of the labour time
employed on it. On the other side, it wants to use labour time as the measuring
rod for the giant social forces thereby created, and to confine them within
the limits required to maintain the already created value as value. Forces
of production and social relations -- two different sides of the development
of the social individual -- appear to capital as mere means, and are merely
means for it to produce on its limited foundation. In fact, however, they
are the material conditions to blow this foundation sky-high. 'Truly wealthy
a nation, when the working day is 6 rather than 12 hours. <I>Wealth </I>is
not command over surplus labour time' (real wealth), 'but rather, <I>disposable
time </I>outside that needed in direct production, for <I>every individual
</I>and the whole society.' <I><A HREF="remedy.htm#rich">(The Source and

The development of fixed capital indicates to what degree general social

hence, the conditions of the process of social life itself have come under
the control of the general intellect and been transformed in accordance
with it. To what degree the powers of social production have been produced,
not only in the form of knowledge, but also as immediate organs of social
practice, of the real life process.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0><I>The development of fixed capital indicates in still
another respect the degree of development of wealth generally, or of capital.
</I>The aim of production oriented directly towards use value, as well
as of that directly oriented towards exchange value, is the product itself,
destined for consumption. The part of production which is oriented towards
the production of fixed capital does not produce direct objects of individual
gratification, nor direct exchange values; at least not directly realizable
exchange values. <I>Hence, only when a certain degree of productivity has
already been reached -- so that a part of production time is sufficient
for immediate production -- can an increasingly large part be applied to
the production of the means of production. </I>This requires that society
be able to wait; that a large part of the wealth already created can be
withdrawn both from immediate consumption and from production for immediate
consumption, in order to employ this part for labour which is <I>not immediately
productive </I>(within the material production process itself). This requires
a certain level of productivity and of relative overabundance, and, more
specifically, a level directly related to the transformation of circulating
capital into fixed capital. As the <I>magnitude of relative surplus labour
depends on the productivity of necessary labour, so does the magnitude
of labour time -- </I>living as well as objectified -- <I>employed on the
production of fixed capital depend on the productivity of the labour time
spent in the direct production of products. Surplus population </I>(from
this standpoint), as well as <I>surplus production, </I>is a condition
for this. That is; the output of the time employed in direct production
must be larger, relatively, than is directly required for the reproduction
of the capital employed in these branches of industry. The <I>smaller </I>the
direct fruits borne by <I>fixed capital, </I>the less it intervenes in
the <I>direct production process, </I>the greater must be this relative
<I>surplus population and surplus production; </I>thus, more to build railways,
canals, aqueducts, telegraphs etc. than to build the machinery </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0>directly active in the direct production process. Hence
-- a subject to which we will return later -- in the constant under- and
overproduction of modern industry -- constant fluctuations and convulsions
arise from the disproportion, when sometimes too little, then again too
much circulating capital is transformed into fixed capital.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0> &lt;<A NAME="128"></A><I>The creation of a large quantity
of disposable time apart from necessary labour time for society generally
and each of its members (i.e. room</I> for the development of the individuals'
full productive forces, hence those of society also), this creation of
not-labour time appears in the stage of capital, as of all earlier ones,
as not-labour time, free time, for a few. What capital adds is that it
increases the surplus labour time of the mass by all the means of art and
science, because its wealth consists directly in the appropriation of surplus
labour time; since <I>value directly its purpose, </I>not use value. It
is thus, despite itself, instrumental in creating the means of social disposable
time, in order to reduce labour time for the whole society to a diminishing
minimum, and thus to free everyone's time for their own development. But
its tendency always, on the one side, <I>to create disposable time, on
the other, to convert it into surplus labour. </I>If it succeeds too well
at the first, then it suffers from surplus production, and then necessary
labour is interrupted, because <I>no surplus labour can be realized by
capital. </I>The more this contradiction develops, the more does it become
evident that the growth of the forces of production can no longer be bound
up with the appropriation of alien labour, but that the mass of workers
must themselves appropriate their own surplus labour. Once they have done
so -- and <I>disposable time </I>thereby ceases to have an <I>antithetical
</I>existence -- then, on one side, necessary labour time will be measured
by the needs of the social individual, and, on the other, the development
of the power of social production will grow so rapidly that, even though
production is now calculated for the wealth of all, <A NAME="127"></A><I>disposable
time </I>will grow for all. For real wealth is the developed productive
power of all individuals. <A NAME="132"></A>The measure of wealth is then
not any longer, in any way, labour time, but rather disposable time. <A NAME="130"></A><I>Labour
time as the measure of value </I>posits wealth itself as founded on poverty,
and disposable time as existing <I>in and because of the antithesis to
surplus labour time; </I>or, the positing of an individual's entire time
as labour time, and his degradation therefore to mere worker, subsumption
under labour. <I>The most developed machinery thus </I></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0> 'If the entire labour of a country were sufficient
only to raise the support of the whole population, there would be no <I>surplus
labour, </I>consequently nothing that could be allowed to accumulate as
capital. If in one year the people raises enough for the support of two
years, one year's consumption must perish, or for one year men must cease
from productive labour. But the <I>possessors of [the] surplus produce
or capital... </I>employ people upon <I>something not directly and immediately
productive, </I>e.g. in the erection of machinery. So it goes on.' <I>(<A HREF="remedy.htm#entire">The
Source and Remedy of the National Difficulties, </A>p. 4</I>.)</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+0> &lt;As the basis on which large industry rests, the
appropriation of alien labour time, ceases, with its development, to make
up or to create wealth, so does <I>direct labour </I>as such cease to be
the basis of production, since, in one respect, it is transformed more
into a supervisory and regulatory activity; but then also because the product
ceases to be the product of isolated direct labour, and the <I>combination
</I>of social activity appears, rather, as the producer. 'As soon as the
division of labour is developed, almost every piece of work done by a single
individual is a part of a whole, <I>having no value or utility of itself.
There is nothing on which the labourer can seize: this is my produce, this
I will keep to myself.' (Labour Defended, </I>p. 25, 1, 2, XI.) In direct
exchange, individual direct labour appears as realized in a particular
product or part of the product, and its communal, social character -- its
character as objectification of general labour and satisfaction of the
general need -- as posited through exchange alone. In the production process
of large-scale industry, by contrast, just as the conquest of the forces
of nature by the social intellect is the precondition of the productive
power of the means of labour as developed into the automatic process, on
one side, so, on the other, is <I>the labour of the individual in its direct
presence posited as suspended individual, i.e. as social, labour. Thus
the other basis of this mode of production falls away.</I>&gt;</FONT></B></P>
