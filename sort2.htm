You have "agreed" with the following three statements. Now select the one statement of the three that you <b>agree with most</b>:
<ul>

<li>I cannot imagine a shorter workweek, I can imagine a longer one if this country is to be competitive in the first half of the next century.<INPUT TYPE="radio" NAME="1" VALUE="compete">
<p>
<li>Work-sharing is ineffective as a job creation strategy because of its potential adverse effects on labor costs.<INPUT TYPE="radio" NAME="1" VALUE="cost">
<p>
<li>The many constraints and conditions which need to be met to achieve a positive and lasting employment outcome preclude any across-the-board measure such as legislated or centrally agreed working-time reductions.<INPUT TYPE="radio" NAME="1" VALUE="preclude">
<p>
</ul>
You have "disagreed" with the following three statements. Select the one statement that you <b>disagree with most</b>:
<ul>
<li>We need to implement a shorter workweek, tax credits for volunteer work and new work in the nonprofit sector to avoid steadily climbing unemployment and its consequent social dislocation.<INPUT TYPE="radio" NAME="9" VALUE="short">
<p>
<li>A major job creation program would be a good idea, but hardly anyone believes we can do it without massive new government spending. The surprising truth is, we can.<INPUT TYPE="radio" NAME="9" VALUE="jobs">
<p>
<li>Economic and political trends make work sharing a more practical proposition.. there is no reason why it should not have some small positive impact on employment over the medium term.<INPUT TYPE="radio" NAME="9" VALUE="politics">
</ul>
