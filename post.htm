  "The concept [work sharing] is based on a fundamental economic misunderstanding known
   as the 'lump of labour fallacy.' This view, rooted in a typically
   static socialist perspective on the economy, is that there is just so
   much work to go round, and this aggregate can be sliced and diced so
   as to create more jobs. It represents yet another branch of
   macroeconomic mythology, which instead of being unable to see the wood
   for the trees, is unable to see the trees for the wood.

   "In theory, provided an unemployed worker already had the requisite
   skills, a job could be created for him if, say, 10 other workers were
   10% less productive. Note that the key to hiring another worker is not
   for the existing workers to work fewer hours, but to be less
   productive; if they produced the same output in 10% fewer hours, the
   extra worker still would not be needed. However, if they agreed to be
   less productive, they would have to expect a corresponding wage
   reduction. Unions tend not to like that part of the economic equation.
   
<P>

   "Meanwhile, increasing employment by making workers less productive has
   other costs, since the new workers -- even if they don't require
   training -- will require additional facilities, and possibly mandated
   non-wage benefits. The cost of such meddling is thus not merely
   reduced flexibility, productivity and wages but reduced profits, along
   with the burden of dealing with yet another layer of bureaucracy.
   Meanwhile, forcing people into jobs where they are not needed reduces
   the number of workers available for new jobs. The whole dynamic of the
   economy is undermined.
   
<P>

   "<B><A NAME="ignorance">Such economic ignorance is compounded by a deliberately distorted view
   of history</A></B>, which sees the dramatic reductions in the work week and
   increases in wages over the past 200 years as the result of union
   pressure and government legislation, rather than of competitive
   markets for labour. Many people have been led to believe that
   governments and unions have been leading the parade of economic
   progress, when all they have ever done is to rush to its head, flags
   waving, and give it something to trip over."
