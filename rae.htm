<H2>John Rae, <I>Eight Hours for Work</I> (London: Macmillan, 1894), Chapter
V</H2>

<P>&quot;The eight hours day is usually preached both with most fervour
and with most success as a gospel for the unemployed. No other argument
has been so prominent or so influential in the present movement as the
promise of mitigating and perhaps extinguishing that most unnatural of
our social maladies, the unwilling idleness of willing hands. Nor is this
any wonder, for what can be more captivating thant the hope of seeing that
troublesome malady become as obsolete as the plague? and what can at first
sight appear either a surer or an easier way of making work for the idle
than cutting a few hours off the work of the busy? The work seems already
found and nothing to remain but count in the men to do it. <B>It is a simple
sum in arithmetic.</B> If 5,000,000 labourers do each twelve hours a week
less work than they do now, how many supplementary labourers must you call
in at 48 hours a week to supply the 60,000,000 hours' service which the
original staff have ceased to render? . . .&quot; </P>

<P>&quot;Now all this is entirely illusory. It stands in absolute contradiction
to our now very abundent experience of the real effects of shortening the
hours of labour, and it stands in absolute contradiction to the natural
operation of economic forces to which it professes to appeal; and the illusion
arises (1st) from simply not observing or apparently caring to observe
the important alteration which the introduction of shorter hours itself
exerts on the productive capacity of the workpeople; and (2nd) from yielding
to the gross but evidently very seductive economic fallacy, which leads
so many persons to think that they will all increase the wealth they individually
enjoy by all diminishing the wealth they individually produce, and to look
for a great absorption of the unemployed to flow from a general restriction
of production, the very thing which in reality would have the opposite
effect of reducing the demand for labour, and throwing multitudes more
out of employ.&quot; </P>
