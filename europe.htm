<hr><h6>Marches européennes / NEWS</h6><strong>Reduction in working hours: France gives the time </strong><p>

The French prime minister announced on Friday October 10, a new bill for the
legal reduction of the working week without loss of salary. French employers
swiftly made their opposition to the new measures known. The president of
the French employers, (Confédération Nationale du Patronat Français, CNPF)
resigned, reckoning that his post should be taken over by a 'combative
president.'
</p><p>

The reduction in working hours, is a logical argument that is defended with
varing shades of nuances by unions, and associations of the unemployed in
France. But all unemployed associations (AC!, APEIS, MNCP) are united in
their demand a 32 hour week tied to job creation and without loss of
purchasing power for wage-earners, whilest the trade unions remained
relatively divided on the question.
</p><p>

The French government¹s position immediately attracted European interest
with resounding effect. The Prodi government crisis in Italy, could solve
their crisis on such similar propositions as the reduction of working hours
as the French measures are based on an agreement  which refers to '35 hours
in 2001' while stipulating it application in practice. 
</p><p>

The French government¹s declaration of the new measures on October 10, is
however very vague. In actual fact, nothing has been fixed, so only
mobilisation by wage-earners and the unemployed will overcome obstacles to a
reduction in working hours with the creation of new jobs. 
</p><p>

The legislative timetable given for negociations (2 years for business
employing more than 10 people, 4 years for the rest)  risks being used by
employers to apply job flexibility and intensify the work routine, cutting
out any positive effects of a reduction in the working week.
</p><p>

The French prime minister, Lionel Jospin, stated that negociations should
include the organisation of work and changes in the working schedule.There
is a great risk that French business will jump on these new provisions, such
as  the cancellation of a fixed working day, that can be used by them to
avoid hiring labour and which will entail a deterioration in working
conditions, because wage-earners will be forced to work according to the
number of hours and length of time  chosen by the employer.
</p><p>

Likewise, even though the government has declared its intention to rexamine
"abuses" arising from legislation encourageing part-time employment, nothing
has been clarified in the new measures planned. Meanwhile, part-time work is
increasingly imposed and wide spread,  to the disavantage of women in
particular.
</p><p>

Financial incentives have been ear-marked for businesses introducing shorter
working hours, at little financial cost to employers. 
</p><p>

Lionel Jospin stated that 35 hours will be introducted  without loss of
salary, but the reduction will be tied to a "moderation of salaries" which
means in employers' jargon, a freeze or a lost of purchasing power.
Actions have already been planned in France, which will allow for the
convergence of those involved in the social movement.
</p><p>

For November 15, the Appeal launched by the National Collective for the
Rights of Women, for a demonstration in Paris; and of course, the November
20, demonstration in Luxembourg.
</p><p>

Other initiatives will also be planned. The bill on the 35 hour week will
not be presented before the French Assembly before the beginning of 1998.
By that time, wage-earners, associations and trade unionists should for time
to build together a mass mobilisation equal to stakes involved.
On a European level, the stakes are high : the creation of a movement for
the reduction in working hours concerning each and everyone.
On November 20, in Luxembourg city, we will be there to defend that idea!

</strong></font><hr></center>

<p>
The historic decision introducing the 35 hour week without loss of pay
represents a major achievement for organized labour in France. Right up
until the last hours before the conference on employment and wages which
was promised in the election platform of the left, it looked as if Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin would capitulate to the increasingly intense
pressure of the bosses' union, the CNPF. The fact the Jospin dealt a blow
to the employers interests immediately  provoked a crisis within the CNPF,
with Jean Gandois resigning from the presidency. He will no doubt be
replaced by a more implacable hard-liner.
</p><p>
"We've been taken for a ride" Gandois declared as he came out of the
conference hall. In announcing his resignation as the main representative
of capitalist interests in France, he said he was "more a negotiator than a
'killer'. I don't have the profile needed to defend business interests
against this government". The CNPF has openly spoken of waging a "war"
against the Socialist-Communist majority, in order to force a retreat on
the 35 hour week, due to become legally obligatory in all workplaces of
more than 10 employees on 1st January 2000.
</p><p>
The bosses are used to being listened to and obeyed by governments. This
decision came as a terrible shock to them. They were not the only ones to
be taken by surprise. Trade-union activists fully expected a climb-down on
the part of the government. Just one week before the conference, Jospin
himself had declared that 35 hours without loss of pay would be an
"anti-economic" measure. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Finance Minister, even
went so far as to say that "everybody knows that such a law would lead to
the destruction of jobs on a massive scale".
</p><p>
Interviewed in the press, Jospin justified his action by saying that the
bosses left him "no choice", in that they obstinately refused to put
forward any alternative proposals which would cost them anything. Someone
described as a "source close to the Prime Minister" was quoted in the daily
Libération as saying: "We hesitated, but in the end we were faced with a
choice between creating profound disappointment with the government and
possibly a crisis within the left coalition, or else annoying the CNPF".
</p><p>
Unfortunately, the two year period between now and the enforcment of the
law will allow the employers to launch a counter attack in the workplaces,
increasing pressure for gains in productivity and "restructuring" the
workplace in an attempt to claw back the cost to them of the reduction in
the working week. Nonetheless, against  a background of massive
unemployment, officially over 3 million and in reality closer to 5 million,
with the increasingly precarious character of work contracts, and the
generalisation of poverty, particularly affecting young people, any attempt
to put the warlike declarations of the CNPF into effect will be a recipe
for major social upheaval.
</p><p>
The 35 hour week is the result of the growing militancy and political
awareness of the French working class. The consciousness of the French
workers has been shaped by the concentrated political and social experience
of the last 5 years. In 1993, the left parties suffered a colossal defeat
in the parliamentary elections of that year, as a direct result of the
complete failure of the right-wing policies pursued by Mitterrand and the
socialist governments under him. Two years later, with the left in disarray
and not presenting any serious alternative to the Balladur government,
Chirac won the presidential election of the basis of a "radical" but
completely demagogic program, which was forgotten as soon as the elections
were over. Right-wing Prime Minister Juppé tried to introduce a "plan" of
Thatcherite counter-reforms, which provoked the biggest wave of strikes and
industrial action ever seen since the revolutionary general strike of 1968.
The victory of the socialist-communist alliance this year was a reflection
of the awakening of the working class in the course of this movement.
</p><p>
Jospin is a moderate right-wing socialist. Public sector companies have
been opened to private capital, and a number of privatisations are
scheduled for the coming months. Immediately after coming to power, he
betrayed the Renault workers at Vilvorde. But such are the hopes invested
in the 35 hour week as a means of fighting unemployment and as a means of
improving the quality of life of working people, that unless the employers
came up with some credible alternative, it would have been extremely
difficult for Jospin to back down.
</p><p>
Paradoxically, the contents of the future law as they have outlined by the
government actually go beyond the demands of two of the three main trade
union confederations, namely Force Ouvrière and the CFDT.
</p><p>
The 35 hours are a great achievement, but rather than being the end of the
battle, this new law will mean an intensification of the class struggle in
France. The labour movement has no guarantee that the law will come into
full effect unless it continues the struggle. The decision taken by the
government in France has already had an impact on the labour movement
internationally, giving rise to renewed demands for cutting hours in a
number of countries, particularly in Italy.
</p><p>
The French workers have shown the way forward. Either we accept the drive
for "flexibility", turning the worker into little more than a machine, to
be exploited as much as possible at the lowest possible cost, intimidated
into accepting low wages and poor conditions by the fear of unemployment,
or else the labour movements of Europe will succeed in imposing genuine
work-sharing without loss of pay, through the 35 hour and further on
through the 32 hour week for all.

<strong>Unions still firm behind shorter workweek</strong>
<p>
Any suggestion that the European Trade Union Confederation
discussion conference called with its research institute, the ETUI, on
2 and 3 October in Brussels on New paths in working time policy
signals a ditching of the demand for the 35-hour week would be jumping
to simplistic conclusions.
</p><p>
The reality is anything but. The negotiated 35-hour week was
reaffirmed at the ETUCs Brussels Congress. It was, is and will remain
a priority for European trade unions.
</p><p>
But today mass unemployment mean that the
reduction/reorganization of working time must be tackled in different
and even more ambitious ways.
</p><p>
So the 35-hour week has acquired new dimensions, like action to cut
overtime, bring in continuing vocational training throughout working
life, opportunities for phased retirement,....
</p><p>
The common aim of all these things must be to create the extra new
jobs needed.
</p><p>
The ETUC stands united with all its national and industry affiliates
in their struggle for these aims, most immediately its French members
with respect to the National Conference on Employment taking place on
10 October in Paris.
</p><p>
The ETUC insists that the employment guidelines due to be discussed at
the European Employment Summit of 21 November must call clearly and
forcefully on the Member States to support the development and
organization of the negotiations on the reduction of working time.
