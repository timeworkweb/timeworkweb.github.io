The Overworked American. (Juliet Schor)</a>
</dt><dd><cite>Schor refutes the entrenched view of neoclassical economists that the length of the work week is chosen by workers rather than employers, buttressing her own view by making a compelling case for increasing satisfaction through working less.</cite>
<p>
</p></dd><dt>The End of Work. (Jeremy Rifkin) --Link discontinued.
</dt><dd><cite>Rifkin wants a shortened workweek, which would provide full employment at 25 to 30 hours weekly.

</dt><dd><cite>The Jobs and Timber Accord announced June 19 by B.C. Premier Glen Clark includes 3,000 new jobs from "new work arrangements" -- mainly reductions in overtime and hours of work to be negotiated in collective bargaining between unions and forest companies. The government has committed to spend up to $20,000,000 to offset payroll costs of the new work arrangements.</cite>

</dt><dd><cite>The design of payroll tax-based programs such as Employment Insurance and the Canada Pension Plan now encourages firms, when they need more labour, to increase overtime hours rather than hire new employees. </cite>

</dt><dd><cite>I believe working time and distribution of work issues merit serious consideration. These are not
magic formulas to remedy unemployment but they definitely have an impact on the labour market.
They have the potential to create jobs, or at least to preserve them. They can improve the balance
between work and family life. They contribute to the development of a healthy and productive
workforce.</cite><p>

</dt><dd>The purpose of this conference was: <cite>to draw

</dt><dd><cite>Inequality in weekly earnings increased in the eighties in Canada. The increase in inequality occurred in conjunction with three facts. First, real hourly wages of young workers fell substantially. Second, the percentage of employees working 35-40 hours per week declined while the fraction of employees working either shorter or longer hours rose. Third, there was a growing tendency for highly paid workers to work longer workweeks.</cite>

</dt><dd><cite> There is compelling evidence of both
                     overwork and underemployment not only across the workforce,
                     but for individual workers (particularly men) who may face bouts
                     of full-time work interspersed with years in which part-time hours
                     are the rule.
