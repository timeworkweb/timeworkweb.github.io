<dt><h3>Editorial -- It's about TIME!</h3>
<dd>A casual observer of political debate in Canada and the United States may be excused for thinking that the really important economic issues have to do with making "our" industries more competitive in the global marketplace and with balancing government budgets.  From the standpoint of large corporations, their public relations minions and the political bag carriers they fund, these are important issues. But from the perspective of working people, the big issues are about making ends meet and finding a balance between "making a living" and actually <i>doing</i> the living.
<p>The conventional wisdom tells us that if we pursue global competitiveness and "fiscal responsibilty", the benefits will trickle down to our personal well-being. Everyday experience tells us otherwise. The more we give up to big corporations, the more they want to take -- of our time, our sovereignty and our personal freedom.
<p>Increasingly, the work that we perform is "bonded labour" -- in the sense that the conditions of our employment, the rates of pay we receive and the availability of income from work are dictated by the iron fist of the currency and bond markets. The time that we give up to paid work (and to unpaid searching for work) brings us less and less income, while the law of compound interest brings the bond owners more and more.
<p>As Pope John Paul II has noted in his Apostolic Letter <i>
<a href="http://listserv.american.edu/catholic/church/papal/jp.ii/jp2-3rd.html">As the Third Millennium Draws Near</a></i>, Old Testament tradition held that just government "consisted above all in the protection of the weak." He emphasizes that an important part of this tradition was the law of the Jubilee year, a solemn custom that commanded the cancellation of all debts and the emancipation of those enslaved by debt. As we approach the millennium, the times is ripe for universal cancellation of debt.
<p>It is als<b></b>o time to rethink the balance sheet of corporate profit and social justice, to <a href="http://www.ratical.com/corporations/">rethink corporations</a> -- what debt do we still owe to those who have enriched themselves with our "blood, sweat, toil and tears?" It is time to reclaim our lives -- and our time -- for our children, our grandchildren, our ancestors and the planet.<p>
