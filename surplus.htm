<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The pamphlet is no theoretical treatise. [It is a] protest
against the false reasons given by the economists for the distress and
the &quot;national difficulties&quot; of the times. It does not, consequently,
make the claim that its conception of surplus value as surplus labour carries
with it a general criticism of the entire system of economic categories,
nor can this be expected of it. The author stands rather on Ricardian ground
and is only consistent in stating one of the consequences inherent in the
system itself and he advances it in the interests of the working class
against capital. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>For the rest, the author remains a captive of the economic
categories as he finds them. Just as in the case of Ricardo the confusion
of surplus value with profit leads to undesirable contradictions, so in
his case the fact that he christens surplus value the interest of capital.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>To be sure, he is in advance of Ricardo in that he first
of all reduces all surplus value to surplus labour, and when he calls surplus
value interest of capital, he at the same time emphasises that by this
he understands the general form of surplus labour in contrast to its particular
forms -- rent, interest of money and industrial profit. </FONT></P>

<P>
<HR>

<DIV ALIGN=right><P><FONT SIZE=+0>389</FONT></P></DIV>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>He thus distinguishes the general form of surplus labour
or surplus value from their particular forms, something which neither Ricardo
nor Adam Smith [does], at least not consciously or consistently. But on
the other hand, he applies the name of one of these particular forms --
interest -- to the general form. And this suffices to make him relapse
into economic slang.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0> &quot;The progress of increasing capital would, in established
societies, be marked by the decreasing interest of money, or, what comes
to the same, the decreasing quantity of the labour of others that would
be given for its use&quot; <A HREF="remedy.htm#interest">([p.] 6)</A>.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0> This passage reminds one of Carey. But with him it is
not the labourer who uses capital, but capital which uses labour. Since
by interest he understands surplus labour in any form, the matter of the
remedy of our &quot;national difficulties&quot; amounts to an increase
in wages; for the reduction of interest means a reduction of surplus labour.
However, what he really means is that in the exchange of capital for labour
the appropriation of alien labour should be reduced or that the worker
should appropriate more of his own labour and capital less.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0> Reduction of surplus labour can mean two things:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0> Less work should be performed over and above the time
which is necessary to reproduce the labour capacity, that is, to create
an equivalent for wages;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0> or, less of the total quantity of labour should assume
the form of surplus labour, that is, the form of time worked gratis for
the capitalist; therefore less of the product in which labour manifests
itself should take the form of surplus produce; in other words, the worker
should receive more of his own product and less of it should go to the
capitalist.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0> <A NAME="disposable"></A>The author is not quite clear
about this himself, as can be seen from the following passage which is
really the last word in this matter as far as the pamphlet is concerned:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0> </FONT><FONT SIZE=-1>A nation is really rich only if
no interest is paid for the use of capital; if the working day is only
6 hours rather than twelve. WEALTH IS DISPOSABLE TIME, AND NOTHING MORE<A HREF="remedy.htm#rich">([p.]
6)</A>. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Since what is understood by interest here is profit, rent,
interest on money -- in short, all the forms of surplus value -- and since,
according to the author himself, capital is nothing but the produce of
labour, accumulated labour which is able to exact in exchange for itself
not only an equal quantity of labour, but surplus labour, according to
</FONT></P>

<P>
<HR>

<DIV ALIGN=right><P><FONT SIZE=+0>390</FONT></P></DIV>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>him the phrase: capital bears no interest, therefore means
that capital [XIV-860] does not exist. The product is not transformed into
capital. No surplus produce and no surplus labour exist. Only then is a
nation really rich.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0> This can mean however: There is no produce and no labour
over and above the product and the labour required for the reproduction
of the workers. Or, they [the workers] themselves appropriate this surplus
-- either of the product or of the labour.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0> That the author does not simply mean the latter is, however,
clear from the fact that the words &quot;no interest [is paid] for the
use of capital&quot; are juxtaposed to [the proposition that] &quot;A nation
is really rich if the working day is 6 hours rather than twelve&quot;;
&quot;wealth is disposable time, and nothing more&quot;.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0> This can now mean: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>If everybody has to work, if the contradiction between
those who have to work too much and those who are idlers disappears --
and this would in any case be the result of capital ceasing to exist, of
the product ceasing to provide a title to alien surplus labour -- and if,
in addition, the development of the productive forces brought about by
capital is taken into account, society will produce the necessary abundance
in 6 hours, [producing] more than it does now in 12, and, moreover, all
will have 6 hours of disposable time&quot;, that is, real wealth; time
which will not be absorbed in direct productive labour, but will be available
for enjoyment, for leisure, thus giving scope for free activity and development.
Time is scope for the development of man's faculties, etc. It will be recalled
that the economists themselves justify the slave labour of the wage labourers
by saying that it creates leisure, free time for others, for another section
of society -- and thereby also for the society of wage labourers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0> Or it can also mean: The workers now work 6 hours more
than the time (now) required for their own reproduction. (This can hardly
be the author's view, since he describes what they use now as an inhuman
minimum.) If capital ceases to exist, then the workers will work for 6
hours only and the idlers will have to work the same amount of time. The
material wealth of all would thus be depressed to the level of the workers.
But all would have <FONT COLOR="#800000">disposable time</FONT>, that is,
free time for their development.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0> The author himself is obviously not clear about this.
Nevertheless, there remains the fine statement: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>A nation is really rich if the working day is 6 hours
rather than twelve. <I>WEALTH IS DISPOSABLE TIME, AND NOTHING MORE.</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>Ricardo himself, in the chapter entitled &quot;Value and
Riches, Their Distinctive Properties&quot;, also says that real wealth
consists in producing the greatest possible amount of values in use having
the least possible value. This means, in other words, that the greatest
possible abundance of material wealth is created in the shortest possible
labour time. Here also, the <FONT COLOR="#800000">&quot;disposable time&quot;</FONT>
and the enjoyment of that which is produced in the labour time of others,
[appear] as the true wealth, but like everything in capitalist production
-- and consequently in its interpreters -- [it appears] in the form of
a contradiction. In Ricardo's work the contradiction between riches and
value later [appears] in the form that the net product should be as large
as possible in relation to the gross product, which again, in this contradictory
form, amounts to saying that those classes in society whose time is only
partly or not at all absorbed in material production although they enjoy
its fruits, should be as numerous as possible in comparison with those
classes whose time is totally absorbed in material production and whose
consumption is, as a consequence, a mere item in production costs, a mere
condition for their existence as beasts of burden. There is always the
wish that the smallest possible portion of society should be doomed to
the slavery of labour, to forced labour. This is the utmost that can be
accomplished from the capitalist standpoint.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0> The author puts an end to this. Time of labour, even
if exchange value is eliminated, always remains the creative substance
of wealth and the measure of the cost of its production. But free time,
<FONT COLOR="#800000">disposable time</FONT>, is wealth itself, partly
for the enjoyment of the product, partly for free activity which -- unlike
labour -- is not determined by a compelling extraneous purpose which must
be fulfilled, and the fulfilment of which is regarded as a natural necessity
or a social duty, according to one's inclination.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0> It is self-evident that if time of labour is reduced
to a normal length and, furthermore, labour is no longer performed for
someone else, but for myself, and, at the same time, the social contradictions
between master and men, etc., being abolished, it acquires a quite different,
a free character, it becomes real social labour, and finally the basis
of <FONT COLOR="#800000">disposable time</FONT> -- the time of labour of
a man who has also <FONT COLOR="#800000">disposable time</FONT>, must be
of a much higher quality than that of the beast of burden.</FONT></P>
