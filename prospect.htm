<h1>Prospectus for <a href="timework.htm">The TimeWork Web</a></h1><hr>
The TimeWork Web is a research project designed to take maximum advantage of the capabilities of hypertext and the Internet. The project focuses on the potential for, and resistence to, <b>substantially</b> reducing average work time. 
<p>
This prospectus is being presented to the public for the purpose of attracting sponsors, subscribers and collaborators for the TimeWork Web project. It is based on an original research proposal submitted to a provincial government ministry. Although the ministry is not funding the research, they evaluated the proposal highly and have offered to provide references where appropriate.
<p>
The results of the research will be made available to the public for the purposes of formulating policy, advancing scholarship and freeing people's time and creativity. It is proposed that the project be funded as knowledge shareware or "know ware". If successful, this model could offer an alternative for funding innovative social policy research.
<p>
Over time, a licensing policy will be developed and explained on this page. It is anticipated that the policy will outline the obligations of people who use the information presented in the TimeWork Web for business or institutional purposes -- including government policy making, formal education, consulting or journalism. The licensing policy will also outline additional services and benefits available to sponsors and subscribers.
<p>
