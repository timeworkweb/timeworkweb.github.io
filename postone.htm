<P><FONT SIZE=+0><I>The development of the social division of time</I>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>At the beginning of this work, I asserted that the notion
of the historical specificity of value, which Marx develops in the <I>Grundrisse</I>,
provides a key to interpreting his mature critique of political economy.
I have shown that this idea is indeed the essential core of Marx's analysis
in <I>Capital</I> of the nature of modern capitalist society and its possible
determinate negation. At this point I shall briefly recapitulate what I
have developed in this chapter and reconfirm the essential continuity of
Marx's analysis in the two texts, by summarizing his conception of the
trajectory of capitalist production in <I>Capital</I> in terms of temporal
categories introduced in the <I>Grundrisse</I> -- that is, in terms of
the development of what I shall call the &quot;social division of time.&quot;
In the process, I shall emphasize the central significance of the notion
of historical nonnecessity. As we have seen, the growing historical nonnecessity
of value-constituting labor -- that is, the necessary presupposition of
capitalism and the constituent of its characteristic form of abstract social
necessity -- is essential to Marx's understanding of capitalism's fundamental
contradiction as one between what is and its own potential (rather than
between what is and what also is). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>In a passage from the <I>Grundrisse</I> quoted at the
beginning of this work, Marx states:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0> </FONT><FONT SIZE=-1>Capital itself is the moving contradiction,
[in] that it presses to reduce labour time to a minimum, while it posits
labour time, on the other side, as sole measure and source of wealth. Hence
it diminishes labour time in the necessary form so as to increase it in
the </FONT></P>

<P>
<HR>

<DIV ALIGN=right><P><FONT SIZE=+0>374</FONT></P></DIV>

<P><FONT SIZE=-1>superfluous form; hence posits the superfluous in growing
measure as a condition -- question of life or death -- for the necessary.<A HREF="#125">[125]</A>
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>My investigation of <I>Capital</I> permits us now to grasp
these temporal categories. Marx's opposition of &quot;necessary&quot; and
&quot;superfluous&quot; labor time is not identical to that of &quot;necessary&quot;
and &quot;surplus&quot; labor time. The former opposition refers to society
as a whole, whereas the latter refers to the class of immediate producers.
In Marx's theory, the existence of surplus production -- more than is necessary
to satisfy producers' immediate needs -- is a condition of all &quot;historical&quot;
forms of social life. One can distinguish in every historical form between
the amount of production required to reproduce the laboring population
and an additional amount, expropriated by nonlaboring classes, &quot;necessary&quot;
for society as a whole. According to Marx, in capitalism the surplus is
value, rather than material wealth and is not expropriated by means of
direct domination. Instead, expropriation is mediated by the form of wealth
itself, and exists in the form of a nonmanifest division between that portion
of the workday in which the workers labor for their own reproduction (&quot;necessary&quot;
labor time) and that portion which is appropriated by capital (&quot;surplus&quot;
labor time). Given the distinction between value and material wealth, so
long as the production of material wealth depends largely on the expenditure
of direct labor time, both &quot;necessary&quot; and &quot;surplus&quot;
labor time can be considered socially necessary. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>This, however, ceases to be the case as the production
of material wealth comes to be based on socially general knowledge and
productive capacities rather than on direct human labor. In such a situation,
the production of material wealth may bear so little relation to the expenditure
of direct labor time that the total amount of socially necessary labor,
in <I>both</I> its determinations (for individual reproduction and for
society generally), could be greatly reduced. The result, as Marx put it,
would be a situation characterized not by the &quot;reduction of necessary
labour time so as to posit surplus labour&quot; but rather by &quot;the
reduction of the necessary labour of society in general to a minimum.&quot;
<A HREF="#126">[126]</A></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0> My examination of the dialectic of the two dimensions
of capitalism's underlying social forms has shown, however, that a general
reduction of socially necessary labor that would be fully commensurate
with the productive capacities developed under capitalism cannot occur,
according to Marx's analysis, so long as value is the source of wealth.
The difference between the total labor time determined as socially necessary
by capital, on the one hand, and the amount of labor that would be necessary,
given the development of socially general productive capacities, were material
wealth the social form of wealth, on the other, is what Marx calls in the
<I>Grundrisse</I> &quot;superfluous&quot; labor time. The category can
be understood both quantitatively and qualitatively, as referring both
to the duration of labor as well as to the structure of production and
the very </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>existence of much labor in capitalist society. As applied
to social production in general, it is a new historical category, one generated
by the trajectory of capitalist production.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0> Until this historical stage of capitalism, according
to Marx's analysis, socially necessary labor time in its two determinations
defined and filled the time of the laboring masses, allowing nonlabor time
for the few. With advanced industrial capitalist production, the productive
potential developed becomes so enormous that a new historical category
of &quot;extra&quot; time for the many emerges, allowing for a drastic
reduction in both aspects of socially necessary labor time, and a transformation
of the structure of labor and the relation of work to other aspects of
social life. But this extra time emerges only as potential: as structured
by the dialectic of transformation and reconstitution, it exists in the
form of &quot;superfluous&quot; labor time. The term reflects the contradiction:
as determined by the old relations of production it remains labor time;
as judged in terms of the potential of the new forces of production it
is, in its old determination, superfluous. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>It should be clear that &quot;superfluous&quot; is not
an unhistorical category of judgment developed from a position purportedly
outside of society. It is, rather, an immanent critical category that is
rooted in the growing contradiction between the potential of the developed
forces of production and their existent social form. From this point of
view, one can distinguish labor time necessary for capitalism from that
which would be necessary for society were it not for capitalism. As my
discussion of Marx's analysis has indicated, this distinction refers not
only to the quantity of socially necessary labor but also to the nature
of social necessity itself. That is, it points not only toward a possible
large reduction in total labor time but also toward the possible overcoming
of the abstract forms of social compulsion constituted by the value form
of social mediation. Understood in these terms, &quot;superfluous&quot;
is the historically generated, immediate opposite of &quot;necessary,&quot;
a category of contradiction that expresses the growing historical possibility
of distinguishing society from its capitalist form, and, hence, of separating
out their previous necessary connection. The basic contradiction of capitalism,
in its unfolding, allows for the judgment of the older form and the imagination
of a newer one. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>My analysis of the dialectic of transformation and reconstitution
has shown that, according to Marx, historical necessity cannot, in and
of itself, give rise to freedom. The nature of capitalist development,
however, is such that it can and does give rise to its immediate opposite
-- historical nonnecessity -- which, in turn, allows for the determinate
historical negation of capitalism. This possibility can only be realized,
according to Marx, if people appropriate what had been constituted historically
as capital. </FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="disposable"></A><FONT SIZE=+0>The understanding of the determinate
negation of capitalism implied by the unfolding of Marx's categories in
<I>Capital</I> parallels what he presents in the <I>Grundrisse</I>. In
the latter, he characterizes a possible postcapitalist society in terms
of the category of &quot;disposable&quot; time: &quot;on the one side,
necessary labour </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>time will be measured by the needs of the social individual,
and, on the other, the development of the power of social production will
grow so rapidly that, even though production is now calculated for the
wealth of all, <I>disposable time</I> will grow for all.&quot;<A HREF="#127">[127]</A>
Marx defines &quot;disposable&quot; time as &quot;room for the development
of the individual's full productive forces, hence those of society also.&quot;<A HREF="#128">[128]</A>
This is the positive form taken on by that extra time, freed by the forces
of production, which under advanced capitalism remains bound as &quot;superfluous.&quot;
The category of superfluous time expresses only negativity -- the historical
nonnecessity of a previous historical necessity -- and therefore still
refers to the Subject: society in general in its alienated form. The category
of disposable time reverses this negativity and gives it a new referent:
the social individual.<A HREF="#129">[129]</A> It presupposes the abolition
of the value form of social mediation: only then, according to Marx, can
(nonalienated) labor time and disposable time complement one another positively
as constitutive of the social individual. Overcoming capitalism, then,
would entail the transformation not only of the structure and character
of social labor but also of nonworking time, and of their relation. In
the absence of the abolition of value, however, any extra time generated
as a result of the reduction of the workday is determined negatively by
Marx, as the antithesis of (alienated) labor time, as what we would call
&quot;leisure time&quot;: &quot;<I>Labour time as the measure of wealth</I>
posits wealth itself as founded on poverty, and disposable time as existing
<I>in and because of the antithesis to surplus labour time</I>.&quot;<A HREF="#130">[130]</A></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0> The trajectory of capitalist production as presented
by Marx can be viewed, then, in terms of the development of the social
division of time -- from socially necessary (individually necessary and
surplus), through socially necessary and superfluous, to the possibility
of socially necessary and disposable (which would entail overcoming the
older form of necessity). This trajectory expresses the dialectical development
of capitalism, of an alienated form of society constituted as a richly
developed totality at the expense of the individuals, which gives rise
to the possibility of its own negation, a new form of society in which
people, singly and collectively, can appropriate the species-general capacities
that had been constituted in alienated form as attributes of the Subject.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0> The development of the social division of time is in
Marx's analysis a function of the complex dialectic of the two dimensions
of capitalism's underlying structuring forms. As I have argued, by grounding
capitalism's directional dynamic in the twofold character of the fundamental
structures of this society, Marx breaks with any notion of a single transhistorical
human history with an immanent principle of development; further, he demonstrates

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>that this directional dynamic cannot be taken for granted
but must itself be grounded by a theory of social constitution. Within
the framework of this interpretation, the emergence of capitalism can be
seen as an ever-less random development with the rise and full unfolding
of the commodity form -- but not as the unfolding of an immanent principle
of necessity. The history of the capitalist social formation, however,
does have an immanent, as opposed to a retrospective, logic, according
to Marx; as a result of its form of social mediation, capitalism is marked
by a form of historical necessity. Yet the dialectic of its underlying
social forms is such that capitalism points beyond itself to the possibility
of a future society based on a different form of social mediation, one
that would be neither quasi-objectively constituted nor traditionally given.
Marx's analysis implies that a society so constituted would allow people
a greater degree of freedom over their lives, individually as well as collectively,
and could be considered a situation of historical freedom. To the degree
that one can speak of a notion of human history in Marx's mature works,
then, it is not in terms of a single transhistorical principle; rather,
it refers to a movement, initially contingent, from various histories to
History to a necessary, increasingly global, directional dynamic constituted
by alienated social forms which is structured in a way that it points toward
the possibility of historical freedom, toward the possibility of a future
society free from any quasi-objective directional logic of development.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The specificity of capitalism's dialectical dynamic, as
analyzed by Marx, entails a relationship of past, present, and future very
different from that implied by any linear notion of historical development.
The dialectic of objectified present time and objectified historical time
can be summarized as follows: In capitalism, objectified historical time
is accumulated in alienated form, reinforcing the present, and, as such,
it dominates the living. Yet, it also allows for people's liberation from
the present by undermining its necessary moment, thereby making possible
the future -- the appropriation of history such that the older relations
are reversed and transcended. Instead of a social form structured by the
present, by abstract labor time, there can be a social form based upon
the full utilization of a history alienated no longer, both for society
in general and for the individual.<A HREF="#131">[131]</A> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>For Marx, then, the historical movement of capitalism,
driven forward by social conflicts structured by the dialectic of labor
and of time, can be expressed in terms of the development of the social
division of time, and results in the possibility that the social meaning
of time be transformed: &quot;The measure of wealth is then not any longer,
in any way, labour time, but rather disposable time.&quot;<A HREF="#132">[132]</A>
</FONT></P>

<P><A NAME="131"></A><FONT SIZE=-1>131. One could draw a parallel between
this understanding of the capitalist social formation's history and Freud's
notion of individual history, where the past does not appear as such, but,
rather, in a veiled, internalized form that dominates the present. The
task of psychoanalysis is to unveil the past in such a way that its appropriation
becomes possible. The necessary moment of a compulsively repetitive present
can thereby be overcome, which allows the individual to move into the future.<BR>
