there is, thank God! no means of adding to the wealth of a nation but by

<P><FONT FACE="times"><FONT SIZE=+0>In the preface to Volume II of Karl
Marx's <I>Capital</I>, Frederick Engels stressed the importance of &quot;this
pamphlet of forty pages, which Marx rescued from oblivion. . .&quot; Engels
called the pamphlet &quot;the most advanced outpost of a whole group of
writings of the 1820s, which turned the Ricardian theory of value and surplus-value
against capitalist production in the interest of the proletariat, and fought
the bourgeoisie with its own weapons.&quot; </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="times"><FONT SIZE=+0>For his part, Karl Marx commented approvingly
in his <I>Economic Manuscripts of 1861-63</I> on the &quot;fine statement&quot;
by the anonymous author of the 1821 pamphlet: &quot;'<B>A nation is really
rich if the working day is 6 hours rather than twelve. W</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=-1><B>EALTH
IS DISPOSABLE TIME, AND NOTHING MORE</B>.</FONT><FONT SIZE=+0>'&quot; In
the <I>Economic Manuscripts</I> and in several passages in the <I>Grundrisse</I>,
Marx seems to be gently palpating meaning from the phrase as he repeats
it several times and mulls over a sequence of interpretations, like Goethe's
Faust contemplating how best to translate <I>logos</I> from the first line
of the New Testament Book of John. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="times"><FONT SIZE=+0>Just how successful Marx was at rescuing
<I>The Source and Remedy of the National Difficulties</I> from oblivion
is open to question. The fine statement that <I>wealth is disposable time</I>
turned out to be, for Marx, not a description of existing reality but the
herald of a humanly desirable and practically achievable future. However,
as Moishe Postone has argued in <I>Time, Labor and Social Domination</I>,
traditional Marxism has overlooked the emancipatory potential that Marx
attributed to disposable time. Too often, Marx's followers have shunted
aside the imperative that wealth be realized as disposable time and have
instead envisioned only a planned and more equitable distribution of commodities.
</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+0>The ideal of the centrally-planned,
state socialist production and distribution of commodities has lost its
popular appeal because in practice it has proven to exacerbate rather than
resolve the problem of political power. Critics invariably latch onto this
paradox of political power -- see, for example, Frederick Hayek's <I>The
Road to Serfdom</I> -- as a fatal flaw of &quot;Marxism&quot;. It would
be more accurate, however, to view the emphasis on economic planning as
a retreat from Marx's crucial insight rather than as a model of the Marxian
alternative. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="times"><FONT SIZE=+0>Such centralized state socialism offers
little more than a pretentiously re-labelled caricature of monopoly capitalism.
Given well-meaning and competent administrators, such a system might smooth
out some of the excesses of unrestrained capitalism. Blessed with less
good fortune, though, it could lead (and, historically, has led) first
to the self-righteous hunt for saboteurs and enemies of socialism to explain
why the charade isn't 'delivering the goods' and ultimately to disillusionment
with socialism and the cynical exhaltation of the market as panacea and
utopia. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="times"><FONT SIZE=+0>What economic planning doesn't -- and
cannot -- address is precisely the revaluation of value suggested by the
principle that &quot;wealth is disposable time, and nothing more.&quot;
As tantalizingly straight-forward as the fine statement may at first appear,
on reflection it bears closer resemblance to a Zen koan than to a revolutionary
slogan. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="times"><FONT SIZE=+0>On behalf of a humanly desirable and
still possible future (and as an aid to meditation), the TimeWork Web presents
excerpts from four key texts on the elusive concept of disposable time:
