OUR TIME FAMINE:  </h1><h2>A Critical Look at the Culture of Work and a
Re-evaluation of 'Free' Time.</h2>
<hr>
<center><b>Iowa Memorial Union - 
University of Iowa - 
Iowa City, Iowa<br>

March 8 - 10, 1996</b></center><hr>
Our mothers and fathers thought that ours would be the century when the
machine and technology freed human beings - freed us to live a life beyond
"necessity" and work, in which our major concern would be "the question of
freedom."   People who lived at the turn of the last century fully expected
that future generations would be better off not just in material goods, but
in the goods of life - in abundant hours and days free from jobs and
economic concerns.
<p>

But we who toil in the century's last decade dare not imagine such a thing.
Instead of our work continuing to decline, as it did, steadily, for a
hundred and fifty years before mid-century, it has expanded.  Now more of
our populations work, and more of us work longer hours than our mothers and
fathers.  Instead of proving to be "labor saving devices," our machines
create more work for more of us to do!  Instead of the "problem" of
leisure, we face an array of problems caused by overwork;  such as families
that erode because we have no time to be at home, troubled and troubling
young people who share little or no time with adults, anemic communities
bled dry of time, their life's blood, and institutions that focus solely on
teaching people how to work rather than how to live together freely.
Even though ours has become the wealthiest nation in history, we languish
in a time famine with no relief in sight.  What happened?
<p>

This conference will bring together leading historians, economists,
educators, labor leaders, and politicians to explore the phenomenon of
work's expansion, the problems overwork has caused, and possible ways to
address them.
<p>

The historical rise of the culture of work and the politics of work
creation will be critically investigated.  Alternative historical visions
of active and democratic cultures based in time outside modern work and
consumerism will be remembered.  The recent, unfortunate results of work's
ascendancy will be explored, including;  the maldistribution of work (the
widening division between the overworked with good jobs and the
under-worked who are unemployed or marginally employed); the
time-starvation of families; and the decay of communities and institutions
outside work/consumption/mass amusements in what J&uuml;rgen Habermas calls the
"collapse of the discussional."
<p>

Traditional, but neglected solutions and remedies, alternative to the
prevailing faiths in perpetual economic growth and politics of eternal work
creation, will be investigated, including;  work redistribution (or work
sharing); regeneration of what Cornel West called "democratic culture" in
leisure, and volunteerism.  Strategies to reclaim free public spaces
"outside" work/consumerism/amusements, and recover "free activities" that
return culture making and transmission to the communities will be proposed.

<h3>JEREMY RIFKIN</h3>

Unexpected Decline of Leisure, a critical look at the tendency of Americans
to spend increasing amounts of time working at the expense of involvement
