<blockquote><p>In 2018, I developed the course, <strong>"The Politics of Working Time"</strong> (LBST 330) for the Labour Studies Program at Simon Fraser University  and have taught it four times. Below is a compilation of the weekly topics we have covered and following that is a list of assigned and recommended <a href="#readings">readings</a> for the course.

<p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>"The future isn't what it used to be"</strong><br />
In the early days of the 1956 presidential campaign, U.S. Vice President Richard Nixon envisioned the achievement of a four-day, 32-hour workweek in the "not too distant future." Sixty years later, the average workweek in the U.S. for full-time workers was 42.5 hours. Seventy percent of all employed persons worked 40 hours a week or more. In Canada about 60 percent of full-time workers and half of all employed workers work 40 hours a week or more. What happened?&nbsp;</p>

<p>
<strong>19th century British factory and trade union legislation</strong><br />
Campaigns for shorter working time drove two major changes in British industrial legislation. The ten-hour movement of the 1830s was answered by Factory Act legislation that limited the hours of work of children, The nine-hour movement of the 1860s introduced Frederic Harrison to the perspective he documented in a Royal Commission minority report that became the basis for trade union legislation.</p>

<p><strong>History of economic thought about working time</strong><br />
Orthodox economic doctrine in the 19th century held that wages and hours of work were strictly determined by the "laws of supply and demand." Limitation of the hours of work time was decried as folly that would bankrupt employers and subsequently impoverish workers. These early prejudices were refuted in the early 20th century but made a strange return in post-WWII economics.</p>

<p><strong>Economics of shorter hours and a living wage</strong><br />
Industrialist Thomas Brassey's On Work and Wages (1872) documented the positive feedback that higher wages and shorter hours contributed to worker productivity. According to the leading American economist of the day, Francis Walker, Brassey's study was "by far the most important body of evidence on the varying efficiency of labor..." a fact Alfred Marshall felt, "will be found to exercise a very complicating influence on the theory of Distribution." Marshall's pupil, Sydney Chapman, formalized the canonical theory of the hours of labour in 1909.</p>

<p><strong>From the eight hour day to the thirty hour week</strong><br />
In the United States, the movement for an eight-hour day was formative for the American Federation of Labor in the 19th century. Ira Steward was the leading thinker of that movement. During the Depression of the 1930s, the movement for a 30-hour workweek led to the legislative enactment of collective bargaining rights. Arthur Dahlberg, who testified before a Senate subcommittee for the 30-hour bill, had a theory that was both similar to, and distinct from, Steward’s.&nbsp;</p><p>
<strong>Getting rid of the Black-Connery 30-hour bill&nbsp;</strong><br />
In the U.S. the movement for an eight-hour day was formative for the American Federation of Labor in the 19th century. During the Depression of the 1930s, the movement for a 30-hour workweek led to the legislative enactment of collective bargaining rights.</p>

<p><strong>The end of shorter hours</strong><br />
In addition to being a central issue in the history of labor movements, the appeal for the limitation of the hours of work was also a vital political issue, at least until the second half of the 20th century when, according to Ben Hunnicutt, it was displaced by consumerism.</p><p>

<strong>The abandonment of collective action for labour/leisure&nbsp;</strong><br />
According to Stanford economist John Pencavel, up until 1957 textbooks for labor economics attributed reductions in hours of work to collective action by trade unions needed to overcome resistance from employers. After publication of an influential paper by economist H. Gregg Lewis, textbooks echoed Lewis's explanation that workers choose their own hours, based on their preferences for income or leisure. Once again, for a new reason, collective action for limiting the hours of work was viewed with disdain by economists.</p>

<p><strong>Work hours, reproduction and radical leisure</strong><br />
The division of labour in capitalism is profoundly and prejudicially gendered, with women performing the bulk of domestic work, while only waged labour "counts" as work in official statistics. Traditional movements for shorter working time reflected and reinforced patriarchy, often with "humanitarian" rationales. Kathi Weeks presents a feminist argument for shorter work time, arguing that the movement "should be conceived as both a demand and a perspective." She stresses the need for "the creation of new ways of living and new modes of subjectivity."</p>

<p><strong>The Source and Remedy of the National Difficulties</strong><br />
An anonymous pamphlet published in 1821 formed a major influence on Karl Marx’s critique of political economy. As Giancarlo de Vivo argues there has been little attention paid to the pamphlet and its author despite the major influence it had. “…where men heretofore laboured twelve hours they would now labour six, and this is national wealth, this is national prosperity. After all their idle sophistry, there is, thank God! no means of adding to the wealth of a nation but by adding to the facilities of living: so that wealth is liberty––liberty to seek recreation––liberty to enjoy life––liberty to improve the mind: it is disposable time, and nothing more.”</p><p></p><p>

<strong>The Commons: labour power as a common-pool resource</strong><br />
For Elinor Ostrom, common-pool resources are goods that don't fit tidily into the categories of either private or public goods. Human capacities to work have elastic but definite natural limits, which must be continuously restored and enhanced through nourishment, rest and social interaction. Over the longer term that capacity for labour also has to be replenished by a new generation of youth, reared by the previous generation. Regardless of whether work is paid or unpaid, the capacity to perform it is the outcome of an intrinsically social, co-operative activity. It is this combination of co-operation, definite limits and the need for continuous recuperation and replacement that gives labour-power the characteristics of a common-pool resource.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Share the work and spare the planet</strong><br />
Studies have shown that reduced work time would make it easier to reach GHG reduction targets while maintaining employment levels. Shorter working time is a key element in proposals such as the U.K. Sustainable Development Commission's Prosperity without Growth. Yet, aside from that report, there has been little official recognition of the role that work time reduction might play in combatting climate change.</p>

<p><strong>Only a Ten Hour Week?</strong><br />
The International Panel on Climate Change has reported that CO2 emissions need to fall by 45% below 2010 levels to avoid the possibility of overshooting 1.5° Celsius of global warming. There is a high correlation between employment and CO2 emissions. What would be the magnitude of the required transition expressed in working time?&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><b>
"The Roller Coaster of Immiseration": Economics of shorter hours revisited</b><br />
Calculating the benefits and costs of varying hours of work is a complex undertaking that has oddly escaped close attention from accountants and economists. There are two possible explanations for this omission: the calculations are too complicated to undertake and/or experts prefer to use assumptions that confirm their biases. In this unit I will outline a methodology for doing a comprehensive calculation.</p>

<p><strong>Covid-19 and the Politics of Working Time</strong><br />
Working time is always a “current event.” A large proportion of the working-age population spends 1/3 or more of their waking hours at work. But for many it took a pandemic to notice the large part that work plays in everyday life. We need policies to help us deal with the fallout from the Covid 19 pandemic such as guaranteed sick pay to ensure that people don’t come to work sick and spread infection and short time compensation to ensure that everyone who wants to work has an opportunity to do so. Continuing the theme of COVID-19 and the politics of working time this week we look at more far-reaching reforms of working time in the context of a “future of work” and at an innovative proposition suggesting that staggering of shorter work weeks could be a strategy for containing infection.</p>
