your Lordship because I <BR>
believe you to be sincere and zealous in your <BR>
public opinions and conduct; and because I<BR>
know you to be a young man, and therefore<BR>
less likely to have your understanding incrusted<BR>
by established and received theories.</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="times"><FONT SIZE=+2> I was confirmed in this intention
by an Essay,<BR>
in a work generally attributed to your Lordship,<BR>
wherein you acknowledge the little satisfaction<BR>
you have hitherto received from the contra-<BR>
dictory opinions of writers on this subject.<BR>
They are indeed, my Lord, contradictory, not<BR>
only the one to the other, but to our best<BR>
feelings and plainest sense. From all the works<BR>
I have read on the subject, the richest nations<BR>
in the world are those where the greatest revenue<BR>
is or can be raised; as if the power of compelling<BR>
or inducing men to labour twice as much at the<BR>
mills of Gaza for the enjoyment of the Philis-<BR>
tines, were proof of any thing but a tyranny<BR>
or an ignorance twice as powerful. </FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="times"><FONT SIZE=+2>How far my own opinions will be
conclusive<BR>
with your Lordship's, I dare not hazard a con-<BR>
jecture; but as many of them are uncommon,<BR>
they may, as Hume says, &quot;repay some cost to<BR>
understand them.&quot; But, my Lord, <I>if they are<BR>
true</I>, they have most important consequences;<BR>
I therefore earnestly intreat you not to reject<BR>
them without a patient and attentive exami-<BR>
nation.</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="times"><FONT SIZE=+2> Here then, my Lord, after having,
for the<BR>
interest of our suffering country, again respect-<BR>
fully solicited your attention throughout the<BR>
progress of this inquiry, I leave off personally<BR>
addressing you.</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="times"><FONT SIZE=+2> </FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>In the consideration
of this important question, we must advert<BR>
to and reason from principles; I shall proceed therefore immediately <BR>
to lay down such as are of immediate consequence to the argument.<BR>
and such as must, I presume, if the wording be not cavilled at, be universally
admitted as true.</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="times"><FONT SIZE=+1> First then, I hold, or rather I
presume it is universally held, that LABOUR IS THE SOURCE OF ALL WEALTH
AND REVENUE. It signifies not how our revenue may come to us, whether as
interest of money-rent of houses, lands, mines, quarries --pensions --
profits of trade -- salary -- tithes: --come what way it will, through
what channel it will, it must be originally derived from labour -- either
our own labour, or the labour of others.</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="times"><FONT SIZE=+1> If then, this first principle be
admitted, it follows conclusively that THE WEALTH OF A NATION, as of an
individual, CONSISTS IN ITS RESERVED LABOUR: the stores either of money,
machinery, manufactures, or produce, &amp;c. &amp;c. that it may possess,
being the evidences and representatives of that reserved labour. </FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="times"><FONT SIZE=+1>It is not my intention to clog this
inquiry with an eternal reference to the opinions of other men -- I shall
hereafter neither controvert nor advert to them; but it will be but honest
to the uninitiated here to admit, that even this simple proposition has
been objected to, and to state the nature of the objection, that he may
be satisfied an endeavour to establish every principle against all possible
objection, would require a folio rather than a letter. Thus it has been
held by some &quot;learned Thebans&quot; to be erroneous, because we omit
the powerful agency of nature: now this is strictly true; but then other
and more &quot;learned Thebans&quot; come upon us with a distinction between
&quot;value in use&quot; and &quot;value in exchange&quot; and show it
is only true of &quot;value in use;&quot; this is still more accurate:
but then it needs two more chapters, and, I ask, might not one chapter
say to the others &quot;we three are sophisticated?&quot; Does not a plain
man find his common interpretation of the language was perfectly correct?
</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="times"><FONT SIZE=+1>At the same time that I shall be
scrupulously studious of brevity, to be clear and intelligible must be
the first consideration; therefore I shall myself refine a little even
upon this second principle, and, for the avoiding future explanation, add,
that the WEALTH OF A NATION CONSISTS IN ITS RESERVED SURPLUS LABOUR by
which I mean the reserved labour beyond its usual and necessary consumption;
for without this distinction, which, though too indefinite and inaccurate,
may serve my purpose, the wealth of a nation would vary with the seasons;
before harvest and after harvest materially. Now, however, that I have
been stayed by this literal accuracy, I may add that when I shall hereafter
speak of the <I>surplus</I> labour of a man, I mean by it, the representative
of all the labour of the individual beyond what is exclusively appropriated
to the maintenance and enjoyment of himself and family, But once for all,
as I profess to neither to be learned nor critical on this subject, I trust
the reader will allow my language the utmost latitude of meaning if by
so doing it may include what is true, </FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="times"><FONT SIZE=+1>or will limit and restrict any particular
word or phrase, if in a general or more extensive sense the opinion would
be erroneous; -- this blundering attempt at definition has already made
me despair of any thing like accuracy. </FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="times"><FONT SIZE=+1>The wealth of a nation having been
now defined to be its reserved surplus labour, I shall add that RESERVED
SURPLUS LABOUR IS CAPITAL, and further, that reserved SURPLUS LABOUR OR
CAPITAL HAS A POWER OF REPRODUCTION, or of FACILITATING PRODUCE <I>when
invested in machinery, lands, agricultural improvements, &amp;c. &amp;c.</I></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="times"><FONT SIZE=+1> These are some of the best principles
with which to begin this inquiry, because they are the least likely to
be disputed; but there are certain consequences I shall proceed to deduce
from them, neither so immediately apparent, nor so certain as to leave
me the same assurance of universal assent. The intent and object of all
writers of political economy has hitherto been, to suggest the best means
of increasing the wealth or capital of a country; now NATURE, I say, HAS
PUT BOUNDS TO THE ACCUMULATION OF CAPITAL, and further, for this is the
great practical purpose of the argument, I hope to shew that THE ACCUMULATION
OF CAPITAL IS VERY LIMITED,<I> if the happiness of the whole, and not the
luxuries of a few, is the proper subject for national congratulation.</I></FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="times"><FONT SIZE=+1> <A NAME="entire"></A>We will examine
the question simply. Suppose the whole labour of the country to raise just
sufficient for the support of the whole population; it is evident there
is no surplus labour, consequently, nothing that can be allowed to accumulate
as capital.</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="times"><FONT SIZE=+1> Suppose the whole labour of the
country to raise as much in one year as would maintain it two years, it
is evident one year's consumption must perish, or for one year men must
cease from productive labour. But the possessors of the surplus produce,
or capital, will neither maintain the population the following year in
idleness, nor allow the produce to perish; they will employ them upon something
not directly and immediately productive, for instance, in the erection
of machinery, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. But the third year, the whole population
may again return </FONT></FONT></B></P>

<CENTER><P>
<HR></P></CENTER>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT FACE="times"><FONT SIZE=+1>5</FONT></FONT></B></H2>

<P><B><FONT FACE="times"><FONT SIZE=+1>to productive labour, and the machinery
erected in the last year coming now into operation it is evident the produce
of the whole will be greater than the first years produce, by the additional
power of the machinery and consequently that the superabundant produce
will be one whole year's consumption, and the produce of the machinery
in addition. It will follow still more necessarily, therefore, either that
this surplus labour must perish, or be put to use as before; and this usance
again adds to the productive power of the labour of the society, and so
on progressively, till men must cease from productive labour for a time,
or the produce of their labour must perish.</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="times"><FONT SIZE=+1> This is the palpable consequence
in the simplest state of society, and neither the detail of figures, the
jargon of our political economists, nor the complexity of existing institutions,
can alter this consequence, although the one may confuse us in discourse,
and the other abuse us in the endeavour; and, in proof, we will proceed
to trace the progress of the accumulation of capital in existing societies,
which will be found confirmatory of what I have stated. </FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="times"><FONT SIZE=+1>The first step is, that the possessor
of capital, never mind how obtained nor how invested, whether in lands,
houses, money, or manufactures, engrosses so much of the labour of others
for the use of his capital, as they are able to benefit by its use, and
this is what is called interest of money, profits of trade, rent, &amp;c.
But as all men that have ever felt the accumulative power of money have
a passion to accumulate it, the accumulation of capital would proceed,
and as capital has a reproductive power, produce would go on increasing,
until no man would avail himself of the capital of another, and consequently
till no man could live on his capital, because no man would give, his labour
for its use*. Here then the evil would have corrected itself, and the society
</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="times"><FONT SIZE=+1>*</FONT><FONT SIZE=+0> Even in these
Utopian speculations. the great land-holder should possibly, be excepted;
a rent, <I>equal to the expense on importation</I>, being always secure
to him. No increase of capital could entirely destroy the rent of lands,
because but a small part of the rental is payment for the use of capital,
but for the use of the land, which no capital can increase; --it is a payment
because the land-holder has a monopoly, a payment for nothing.</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>

<P><B><FONT FACE="times"><FONT SIZE=+1>would be in the same situation as
in the first year, with this difference only, that its surplus produce
<I>must perish</I>, because there is no further means of investing it.
</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><A NAME="interest"></A><B><FONT FACE="times"><FONT SIZE=+1>THE PROGRESS
OF THIS INCREASING CAPITAL WOULD, <I>in established societies</I>, BE MARKED
BY THE DECREASING INTEREST OF MONEY, or, which is the same thing, the decreasing
quantity of the labour of others that would be given for its use; but so
long as capital could command interest at all, it would seem to follow,
that the society cannot have arrived at that maximum of wealth, or of productive
power, when its produce must be allowed to perish. </FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><A NAME="rich"></A><B><FONT FACE="times"><FONT SIZE=+1>When, however,
it shall have arrived at this maximum, it would be ridiculous to suppose,
that society would still continue to exert its utmost productive power.
The next consequence therefore would be, that where men heretofore laboured
twelve hours they would now labour six, and<I> this</I> is national wealth,
this is national prosperity. After all their idle sophistry, there is,
thank God! no means of adding to <I>the wealth of a nation</I> but by adding
to the facilities of living: so that wealth is liberty -- liberty to seek
recreation -- liberty to enjoy life -- liberty to improve the mind: it
is disposable time, and nothing more. Whenever a society shall have arrived
at this point, whether the individuals that compose it, shall, for these
six hours, bask in the sun, or sleep in the shade, or idle, or play, or
invest their labour in things with which it perishes, which last is a necessary
consequence if they will labour at all, <I>ought to be</I> in the election
of every man individually.</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="times"><FONT SIZE=+1> The decreased value of capital
is however so certain a consequence, that if we could ascertain the actual
value of the surplus produce of any society at any given time, if we could
foresee the exact progress of improvement and machinery in facilitating
labour, or multiplying its powers, and the necessary expenditure of human
labour in their improvement and erection, we could, allowing for the progressive
increase of society, by the common rule of proportion, ascertain almost
to an hour when capital, would cease . . . </FONT></FONT></B></P>
