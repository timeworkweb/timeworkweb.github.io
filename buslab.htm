<h1>Business and Labour: missing the point?</h1><h2>by <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19990417211420/mailto:timework@vcn.bc.ca">Tom Walker</a><hr></h2>
"On the surface, it seems like an intriguing idea. With more than 1.4 million Canadians out of work, and with some of those holding jobs putting in longer hours, why not expand the amount of employment by redistributing working time?"<p>
Thus begins Jock Finlayson's column in the June 4 issue of <cite>Business in Vancouver</cite>. Finlayson is vice president of policy and analysis for the Business Council of B.C. </p><p>
Finlayson's rhetorical "why not" is no Robert Kennedyesque plea for social change, however. He goes on in the column to spell out what he thinks are the decisive arguments against redistributing working time. Why not, indeed.</p><p>
Finlayson's dismissal of the work-sharing idea is shallow. He equates work sharing with government legislation to impose mandatory work sharing. Then he (quite prudently) points out the difficulties of such a legislated redistribution of work.</p><p>
After contrasting the "fairy-tale economic thinking of the Canadian Labour Conference" with the "real-world" necessity to link job sharing to lower incomes, Finlayson briefly touches on a factor that should receive more scrutiny than he affords it: the non-wage portion of labour costs. In Finlayson's view, enforced job sharing would raise the non-wage costs of labour. That is, employers would have to pay more than they currently pay for such things as training, payroll taxes and employee benefits. Finlayson is correct as far as he goes. </p><p>
What Finlayson overlooks, however, is that the current level of so-called "fixed", non-wage costs of labour is not written in stone. The current structure of payroll taxes and benefits in Canada actually rewards employers for using overtime instead of hiring and training new workers. In other words, there is already in place legislation to impose mandatory work redistribution. The problem is that the work is redistributed in the wrong direction.</p><p>
Any regime of taxation and regulation of work will redistribute work, either by design or as an unintended consequence. Finlayson cites the 1994 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Jobs Study as evidence that job sharing doesn't cut unemployment. But the job sharing efforts reviewed in that volume were timid affairs, flimsy add-ons to basically unchanged regulatory and tax structures. </p><p>
In such circumstances, the productivity gains from marginal reductions in work time and the negative effects of moonlighting predictably overwhelmed any contribution to reducing unemployment. Far from offering an objective evaluation of job sharing, the evidence only confirms the truism that half-hearted gestures are ineffectual. What is needed is not jerry-built tinkering on top of a badly designed existing system, but a redesign of the whole system that takes into account current needs, trends and norms of work.</p><p>
The question that needs to be asked is not whether government can effect redistribution (it can and does), but whether it is a legitimate public policy objective to promote inequality. Asked in this way, there can only be one answer. No.</p><p>
In keeping with his stance in favour of voluntary and market-based solutions, one might expect Finlayson to decry policies that actively promote overtime and that create obstacles to a more equitable distribution of work. As he points out, voluntary and market-based job-sharing is already practiced by many large companies. Why not make it easier to extend the practice?</p><p>
</p><h2>The View From Labour</h2>
In his companion column, Ken Georgetti, president of the B.C. Federation of Labour expresses support for work-sharing as an obvious, partial solution to unemployment. As Georgetti points out, "Canadians work millions of hours of overtime a year, and even in unionized settings, most workers have no right to refuse." Yet efforts to focus public debate on work sharing are resisted by business leaders.<p>
Georgetti lays much of the blame for inertia on employers. He points out that employers are the main beneficiaries of extended work hours and highlights two efforts by unions to spread employment by limiting excess work.</p><p>
Although negotiating limits to work time on a contract-by-contract basis has its benefits, Georgetti doesn't foresee much progress on the issue until there is a national consensus that the social and economic costs of unemployment are unacceptably high. Georgetti, however, glosses over labour's lacklustre performance in building such a consensus.</p><p>
His examples of the Canadian Auto Workers and the Vancouver postal workers, while salutary, are notable as exceptions rather than as typifying the response of labour to the work time issue. As Jock Finlayson notes in his column, one obstacle to work-sharing is the "reluctance of workers to countenance a decline in their incomes." And many unionized workers persuade themselves that accustomed overtime premiums are an indispensable part of their total income. Labour leaders do little to educate their members about the folly of overtime.</p><p>
Aside from blaming business for resisting change or issuing vague calls for a national consensus on unemployment, is there anything that unions themselves could do to inspire change and build a consensus? Yes, Plenty. </p><p>
Unions could use their influence over the administration of pension funds to ensure that those funds' investments promote a more equitable distribution of work. Unions members could discipline and discourage overtime hogging by imposing a "solidarity levy" on overtime income. After all, the heart of unionism is the idea that "an injury to one is an injury to all." Why should any individual worker economically benefit from an unjust distribution of work? Unions could lead in funding and publicizing independent policy research to follow up on the report of the Federal Advisory Group on Working Time. </p><p>
Perhaps most importantly, unions could turn away from their customary pre-occupation with servicing their members' short-term prospects and focus on building a broad coalition to fight (not whine about) unemployment. As long as the iceberg of unemployment looms, routine contract servicing amounts to the proverbial rearranging of deck chairs on the Titanic.</p><p>
</p><h2>Worth Doing Anyway</h2>
In their respective columns, Finlayson and Georgetti share a perception that what is at stake is primarily the relationship between overtime and unemployment. Advocates of shorter work time have contributed to this perception by emphasizing the potential job creation benefits of reducing work time. It is a compelling or, as Finlayson notes, intriguing, idea. But what if it is beside the point?<p>
What if what matters in people's lives is the balance between the time they spend in paid employment and that in other activities, such as friendship, family responsibilities, and civic involvement? What if income from employment is a misleading measure of personal and societal well-being? In other words, what if work time reduction is worth doing anyway, regardless of whether or not it reduces unemployment? </p><p>
Ken Georgetti alludes to this possibility in his retelling of an anecdote about a child's Sunday drive. "When the child asked why a ploughed field was covered with thousands of little stones, he was told the farmer had worked his fields on a Sunday, so all his potatoes turned to stone." Unfortunately, Georgetti too quickly drops that line of reflection to focus on the economic trade-offs.</p><p>
If balanced lives matter, we can easily replace the dismal trade-offs with a happy dilemma: any reduction of unemployment would come as a welcome bonus, not the sole objective of work-time redistribution. Reducing the number of hours that people spend in paid employment need not be a panacea for economic ills nor a social policy silver bullet. For that matter, one of the tried and true ways of scoffing at the idea is to say, "It's no panacea."</p><p>
Right. And who says that an improvement in our lives has to be a panacea before it qualifies as something worth doing? Should we instead go on heedlessly planting Sunday potatoes destined to turn to stone in our children's fields?</p><p>
