<h1>Lost Time: Time, Work and Family<hr></h1><p>
</p><blockquote><cite>Time is the element in which we exist. ... We are either borne along by it or drowned in it.</cite>  <p>
  --  Joyce Carol Oates</p><p></p></blockquote>
Family, friendship, community, democracy -- all these take time. So does earning a living. Conflicts between work and family responsibilities have been cited by studies ranging from the Canadian National Child Care Study to the Report of the Advisory Group on Working Time and the Distribution of Work. As the latter report notes: <p>
</p><blockquote>There is a "time crunch" counterpoint to the income and jobs polarization... Family incomes are being squeezed in the 1990s. To the extent that they are being maintained it has been at a cost -- the lost time with partners, children, friends and in the community.</blockquote><p>
Paradoxically, this "lost time" is usually treated as a peripheral, even though regrettable, aspect of seemingly irresistible social and economic changes sweeping the world. From the child's point of view, however, time is "of the essence". Parental care and attention is not something that can be concentrated into bursts of "quality time" nor can it be borrowed from to boost current income and repaid at a more convenient date. Time and care are either "here, now" or they are not. </p><p>
The uncounted cost of this loss of time is a deficit in the healthy, socially positive development of children. Nor can all of this cost be swept under the rug or kept off the books. Much of it will show up in demands for increased government services to children -- increased child protection and apprehension case loads, increased rates of youth delinquency and need for correctional facilities, etc. </p><p>
The rights and interests of children are inextricably embedded in the larger social context in which they live. In North America, the currently fashionable watchwords for that larger social context are "global competitiveness", "economic restructuring", and, of course, building the ubiquitous "information superhighway". </p><p>
What these code words seem to mean in plain english is that adults, including parents, are expected to sacrifice more of their time to working, looking for work, preparing themselves for work, being on call for work and recovering from overwork. It goes almost without saying that "work" in this scenario means paid employment. Housework and child care are, more than ever, something people (mostly women) do in their "free time".</p><p>
Where children, youth and families fit in this leaner, meaner scenario is somewhat of a puzzle. To be sure, there is public alarm about children being lured to pornographic sites on the Internet and there are solemn conferences of government officials and business executives about the need to "re-invent schooling" in order to prepare youth for the highly competitive, technological work world of the future. But there is scarce official attention paid to what all this restructuring and competition might mean in the daily lives of children as they grow up in a rapidly changing and increasingly dangerous world.</p><p>
Could it be that the programmers and strategists of the brave new world have simply overlooked the intransigent humanness of children? Or -- as is perhaps more likely -- do they simply assume that children, youth and families will "just have to adjust to the new reality, like everyone else"? Re-engineering childhood, anyone?</p><p>
What are the implications of such adjustment to lost time and care?  What are the consequences for children's development of growing up in a world in which the majority of parents are either overworked, underemployed or out of work? How does the "flexibilization" of the workforce affect the family? Is an on-call, just-in-time, revolving-door, double-income and overtime work schedule compatible with the needs of children for stable, caring parental involvement? </p><p>
How much will taxpayers be willing to spend in the future on government services to intervene, remediate and, ultimately "correct" (in the sense of "corrections institutions") the legacy of child neglect that foreseeably will arise from economic restructuring as it is currently being practiced? And, ultimately, how will those government services to children be organized and delivered? Will service agency staff themselves be compartmentalized, untrained, "permanently temporary" and overworked? Will they be conveniently replaced by an "automated child protection system?" Will the administration of services be structured according to administrative efficiency or child-centred effectiveness?</p><p>
Justice Thomas Gove has warned about the consequences of allowing current ministerial administrative structures to drive child welfare service delivery:</p><p>
</p><blockquote>From an organizational or corporate perspective, housing these different services [child protection, health, education, justice] within these different ministries makes good sense. Administering child health services is closely related to administering health services generally. Administering a youth corrections program is similar to administering an adult corrections program.<p>
But that is the problem. Categorizing child-related services this way makes good sense from the administrator's point of view, but very bad sense from the child's point of view. Who's point of view is more important? To ask the question is to answer it.</p><p>
As long as we continue to allow the current administrative structures to drive the delivery of child welfare services, we will have the unprincipled, dysfunctional and inefficient system which contributed to the suffering and death of Matthew [Vaudreuil], and to many others like him.</p><p></p></blockquote>
Is it conceivable that we can achieve child-centred government services, or even wholeheartedly advocate for them, as a subset of an overwhelmingly corporate-centred social agenda (one that is, itself, increasingly "unprincipled, dysfunctional and inefficient")? What happens if we look at these questions and try to answer them from the perspective of the child, as Justice Gove sought to look at the delivery of child protection services from the perspective of Matthew Vaudreuil?<p>
To a remarkable -- and rarely acknowledged -- extent, the polarization of family incomes and of work and working time that has evolved over the past several decades has been accelerated by regimes of taxation and regulation, benefit programs and insurance premiums, all of which were never designed or intended to accomplish such perverse results. In other words, much maldistribution of work, work time and income is inadvertently subsidized. So it is not simply a question of government failing to respond to the loss of family time. Government policies are actively making the situation worse.</p><p>
As Penelope Leach says in her book, <cite>Children First: what our society must do -- and is not doing -- for our children today</cite>, "There are better choices for children available to us. We are not making them because we are not seeing them. We are not seeing them because we are not looking."</p><p>
