<strong>Introduction: A Day in the Life of a Policy Scavenger</strong></p><p>

Outside and four floors below three-year old Reuben's bedroom window, dawn brings the rustling and clinking of dumpster divers foraging in the alley -- a ragged army of <cite>lumpen-trepreneurs</cite> trooping from bin to bin. Motley as they may appear, these scavengers represent the leading edge of employment in the 21st century.</p><p>

Three years ago, when Reuben was born, his father still called himself a policy researcher, specializing in social policy issues. That was before the income side of the policy research equation was eroded by a "family values" conflict with his ex-employer (she didn't relish keeping the sleep-deprived father of a new-born baby on the payroll) and the widespread disappearance of Canadian government funding of research for non-profit organizations. These days, Reuben's dad is trying to emulate the dumpster divers, rummaging through the vast rubbish heap of government policy for discarded, but still serviceable remnants.</p><p>

Perhaps a rubbish heap is, after all, the best image for the rough jumble of jurisdictions, laws, budgets, regulations, evasions, habits, agencies and officials that together make up the policy apparatus of the state.  Certainly, nothing could be more fanciful than those austere "organization charts" that purport to describe the official structures, priorities or procedures of government. The state is not a hierarchical, hieroglyphic tree; it is a stinking, rotting, seething heap. And this description is not meant to be derogatory.[real audio sound clip: the rubbish heap of policy</p><p>

From time to time, visions of bulldozer reform sprout in the heads of the restless. Whether it's revolution or re-engineering, these dreams share the slogan -- "tear it down and start over from scratch". Aside from the sheer terror involved in such a Herculean task, bulldozer reform doesn't add up. The cost of getting from here to there -- from state A to state B -- could be more than it's worth. And even if it isn't, there's the question of who's going to do it?</p><p>

I can't count the number of times I've read an otherwise worthwhile critique of some current social distress followed by a sweeping set of vague but high-minded policy recommendations intended to fix the problem. The proposed policies are never anything that any incumbent gang of hooligans would consider for a moment and the method for installing a new gang of hooligans is never discussed in any convincing way. Albeit, occasionally the odd fragment of a recommendation will be plucked from its context and presented, with great fanfare, as window dressing by a clever official. Then, if anything ever goes wrong, the whole mess can be blamed on the slender piece of half-hearted progressive reform.</p><p>

Policy scavenging might offer a promising way out of the dilemma of wanting to do too much all at once and not knowing where to start. The starting point can be some neglected but useful item, perhaps half buried in the policy heap. And occasionally, while rummaging around, one finds a diamond in the dust bin.</p><p>

I have found just such a diamond while sifting through the piles of discarded policy stories about reducing work time and redistributing work, and I want to share that discovery with you. But before I do, I need to set the stage with one more prop -- an account of a day in the life of a policy scavenger:</p><p>

<strong>Monday, November 18, 1996</strong>[note: the highlighted quotations in this section are real-audio sound clips].</p><p>

I check my email and mark high priority on the four or five messages -- one from a university professor in Saskatchewan, another from Ottawa, a third from the Netherlands, a fourth from across town -- that are addressed expressly to me. I finish a reply to the assistant deputy minister for strategic policy of Human Resources Development Canada. I write a two-page workshop proposal and compile 10 pages of supporting documents to fax to the regional education director of the Canadian Labour Congress. I call the regional office to get the fax number and confirm my meeting with the director the next day. I write a reply to the New Democratic Party's federal employment critic and include comments on a position paper he has sent me.</p><p>

Then, at 11:30, I stop abruptly and come upstairs to take over child care duties while my partner leaves to do a four hour shift at one of her three on-call jobs as a librarian. Because we don't own a car, a four hour shift usually requires two more hours of travel time on transit. However, because it has snowed this morning, today will have to allow for an extra hour of travel time. On a good day, my three year old will have a nap in the afternoon. But "not today".</p><p>

<"What's Reuben doing?" We go to the playground, but it's too cold and wet to play. We go to the library, but it's closed -- government funding cutbacks. We take a bus that goes past the "freight train store"; we spend the next hour and a half loitering in the freight train store. At 3:00, we leave for home. "No, not to go home." We catch a "garbage truck" bus, but the "up seats" are full and Reuben almost breaks down in tears. "And the peoples is get out of my seat."</p><p>
When we get home, we read a story in bed but after the second time through the story, Reuben announces "woke up" and stands his ground until the attempt at nap time is abandoned. "Yea, I think I can." When I prepare dinner, Reuben refuses to allow me to get a pot out of the cupboard and then insists on pouring water from "the box" into the measuring cup and into his own pot. I divine that now he is not just tired -- he's hungry, too -- and shuffle up a deck of peanut butter crackers. "Yeah!".</p><p>

Meanwhile I make mental checklists of the unfinished business of the day:
</p><ul>
<li>writing a draft for the conference on Technology, Employment and Community in L.A.
</li><li>reading student assignments from a workshop on project management I teach.
</li><li>writing a reply to the provincial minister of employment and investment.
</li><li>compiling a package of materials to send to the research director of the provincial labour federation.
</li><li>calling the provincial head of a national small business organization about a research report.
</li><li>faxing off scraps of information to various people.
</li><li>replying to (or even reading) my email messages.
</li></ul>


By the time Reuben's mother gets home at 7:00 p.m., I'm too exhausted to do any of these tasks and settle for loading the dishwasher.<p>

In case you haven't guessed it, the unifying theme of my day is <strong>DISCONTINUITY</strong>. Tolerance for discontinuity is a prerequisite for policy scavenging. It is also a necessity for <a href="worksite1999.htm%20#cope"><cite>coping with daily life in an era of unrelenting technical change</cite></a>. Unfortunately, tolerance for discontinuity runs against the narrative expectations of our culture. (And, for now, I'd like to deliberately leave the emphasis of that "unfortunately" vague.)</p><p>

The policy scavenger's day encompasses many of the diverse features of the changing nature of work and workplaces: self employment, working from home, underemployment, unpaid social labour, on-call or contingent work, dual-earner families, the difficult fit between work schedules and child care arrangements, the integrated use of the internet in communications -- long hours, low pay (when spread over the total number of hours worked), high stress and chronic insecurity.</p><p>

It doesn't have to be like this. As a growing list of social commentators have pointed out, we could all live calmer, more balanced, more satisfying lives if we simply chose to share -- rather than hoard -- the labour saving gains of technology. Stephen Leacock -- best known as a writer of comic short stories -- made this point eloquently seventy five years ago. What are we waiting for?</p><p>

We could spend more years investigating and documenting what is wrong, but it is enough to open our eyes to know what is wrong. We could spend more decades investigating and documenting what to do about it, but we already know what to do. What we need to do is find out how to do something -- now -- that moves us in the direction of what needs to be done.</p><p>

Policy scavenging is an approach that modestly seeks to find small, doable "irresistible" policy options that can serve as strategic pressure points for unlocking a systematic policy gridlock.</p><p>

<strong>The Diamond in the Dustbin</strong></p><p>

And now, the reward for those whose tolerance for discontinuity has brought them this far in my presentation -- "the diamond".</p><p>

In short, the diamond is a tiny, perfect policy proposal for creating an estimated 30,000 new full-time, well paying jobs in Canada at no cost to the government, to employers, to the environment -- at no cost to anybody. Thirty thousand jobs at an average salary of $35,000 a year would be worth a total of over a billion dollars.</p><p>

This policy proposal creates those jobs by making it possible for people to live more balanced lives by voluntarily working less overtime hours and by making it possible for employers to voluntarily create more family friendly workplaces. No compulsion, no regulation, no interference in the marketplace -- simply the removal of an existing obstacle (compulsion, regulation, interference) that serves no apparent policy purpose.</p><p>

Admittedly 30,000 jobs is not a huge drop in the bucket. A billion dollars? Well, as former Canadian Finance Minister, C.D. Howe, said "What's a billion?" But the neat thing about this policy proposal isn't it's magnitude. As I mentioned before, this policy proposal is perfect. How often do you encounter perfection?</p><p>

The recommended action is entirely within the Canadian federal government's jurisdiction and involves no encroachment on other interests. It has no conceivable deleterious side effects or unforeseen consequences. It doesn't harm productivity or efficiency. It doesn't require an ideological shift and it doesn't cost the taxpayer, or anybody else, a cent. It is "worth doing anyway" in that, even if it wouldn't create a single new job, it would make the tax system more equitable.</p><p>

Perhaps the proudest measure of my proposal's perfection is that it can be stated clearly in less than 25 words: <strong><cite>Remove the ceiling on the employers' portion of federal payroll taxes. Lower the overall rate to make the change revenue neutral.</cite></strong></p><p>

There are only two conditions that could prevent the Canadian government from adopting this policy:

</p><ul>
<li>if it is the deliberate, immutable and openly admitted policy of the Canadian government to maintain unemployment at artificially high levels; and/or
</li><li>if it is the deliberate, immutable and openly admitted policy of the Canadian government to redistribute income and earnings opportunities from lower income individuals to higher income individuals.
</li></ul>


In other words, the only argument that the government could advance against this proposal would be to proclaim itself unfit to govern.

<a name="foot1">1. </a>This presentation is part on an ongoing research peregrination that began in June 1995, with a proposal for funding for applied research and policy analysis submitted to the B.C. Ministry of Employment and Investment to investigate "Labour Market Changes in Work Time and the Distribution of Work" (adapted for the web as "<a href="timework1999.htm">TimeWork Policy Research</a>). A modified proposal outline, "<a href="losttime.htm">Lost Time: Work/Family Conflicts and Government Services to Children</a>," was submitted to the B.C. Office of the Child, Youth &amp; Family Advocate in May of 1996. The <a href="worksite1999.htm">TimeWork Web</a> is itself an outgrowth of the original policy proposal, as are "<a href="martin.htm">an open letter to Paul Martin</a>" and a background memorandum on "<a href="backgrnd.htm">Payroll Taxes, Unemployment, Inequality and Working Time</a>". To date, the project remains unsullied by institutional funding.
