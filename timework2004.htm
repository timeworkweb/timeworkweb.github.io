and Nothing More.<br>
</font></font></A></B><I><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">. . .not the reduction of necessary labour time
so as to posit surplus labour, but rather the general reduction of the
necessary labour of society to a minimum, which then corresponds to the

the Hours of Labour<br>
</font></A></B><I><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Sidney J. Chapman's 1909 address on the &quot;Hours
of Labour&quot; was considered the &quot;classical statement of the theory
of 'hours' in a free market&quot;, (J.R. Hicks, Theory of Wages, 1932).
Then it virtually vanished from the economics discourse. Why?</font></I> </P>

how reducing work time really works to create jobs<br>
</font></A></B><I><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">A presention to the Operation:JOBS Roundtable.
Reducing the hours of work is not an economic panacea. The efficiency gains
from shorter hours -- and the long term employment gains -- don't come
automatically from the reduction in hours. They come from intelligent adjustment
to the change in hours.</font></I> </P>

Campaign for Reduced Working Time<br>
</font></A></B><I><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Miscalculations in costing contract proposals
weaken the labour movement's pursuit of shorter working time through collective
bargaining. And they may contribute to settlements that contain unnecessary
concessions to management. More accurate and time sensitive contract costing
could help avoid these pitfalls.</font></I></p>

reality in which many job seekers have become discouraged or take part-time
work.<br>
People who have prospered owe something back to
the community that has enabled them to prosper.<br>
There are few economic problems that cause as
much suffering as unemployment.</font></I></p>
