<P><B>From D.F. Schloss, &quot;Why Working-Men Dislike Piece-Work.&quot;
<I>The Economic Review</I>, Vol. I, No.3, April 1891, pp. 311-326</B></P>

<P> . . . A man employed in a dockyard in making &quot;washers&quot; by
the aid of a boring-machine, was asked by a visitor (whom this workman
apparently took to be a trade union &quot;investigator&quot;) how many
washers he was making per day. The answer was -- &quot;Now that I am on
piece-work, I am making just about double what I used to make when on daywork.
<I>I know I am doing wrong. I am taking away the work of another man</I>.
But I have permission from the Society.&quot; The words in italics are
referable to the belief so firmly entertained by a large section of our
working-classes -- whether employed on time-work or piece work -- the conviction
that for a man to exert his energies up to the point which just stops short
of undue exertion -- to do his level best -- is inconsistent with his own
interests, and with loyalty to the cause of labour. The basis of this belief,
which is in a large measure responsible for the unpopularity of piece-work,
is that noteworthy fallacy to which I desire to direct attention under
the name of &quot;the theory of the Lump of Labour.&quot;</P>

<P> In accordance with this theory it is held that there is a certain fixed
amount of work to be done, and that it is best in the interests of the
workmen that each shall take care not to do too much work, in order that
thus the Lump of Labour may be spread out thin over the whole body of work-people.
As the result of this policy, it is believed that the supply of available
labour being in this manner restricted, while the demand for this labour
remains (as it is supposed) unchanged, the absorption into the ranks of
the employed of those who are now out of work will follow as a necessary
consequence. At the same time, since (as it is assumed) two masters will
now be running after one man, the operatives, having succeeded in this
&quot;corner,&quot; will, it is hoped be able to obtain for their labour
a very much better price than at present.</P>

<P> In many of the rules prohibiting a man from doing his level best we
can recognize the influence of the ideas now under consideration. Thus
the Bradford lodge of the Labourers' Union was, during the Trade Union
Commission of 1867-1869, shown to have the following rule: --</P>

<P> &quot;You are strictly cautioned not to overstep good rules, by doing
double the work you are required by the society, and causing others to
do the same, in order to get a smile from the master. Such foolhardy and
deceitful actions leave a great portion of good members out of employment
all the year round.&quot;</P>

<P> The theory of the Lump of Labour will be seen to rest upon the utterly
untenable supposition that a fixed amount of work exists, which has to
be done, and will be done, irrespective of the conditions under which work
is done, and, in particular irrespective of the efficiency of the labour
employed; and that, the more work is done by any one workman, the less
work remains to be done by all other workmen. A full treatment of this
subject would take us too far afield. But the character of this fallacy
will best be understood, if the objections entertained to a man's doing
his level best is compared with the precisely similar objection to a man's
using the best available tools; in other words, with the popular objection
to the use of motor power and machinery. No clear thinker believes that,
in order to provide labour for the unemployed, it is advisable that we
should give up steam-ploughs for ordinary iron-ploughs, these again for
wooden ploughs, and, in the ultimate resort, should abandon these instruments
and scratch the ground with the fingers. Just so, in regard to this doctrine
of the Lump of Labour, it should be perceived that it is against the best
interests of the community at large, and, first and foremost, of the working-classes,
for working-men to handicap the industry of the nation in deference to
a theory which proclaims it to be the duty of every man to work, as it
were, with one hand tied behind his back.</P>

<P> <A NAME="length"></A>With the question of the length of the working-day
<B>we have nothing here to do</B>. Still, I shall not conceal my opinion
that the claim of the working-classes to possess an amount of leisure adequate
for the purposes of rest, of education, and of recreation is one in an
eminent degree deserving of recognition. But, while a reduction of the
hours of labour -- say, to eight in the day -- may readily be admitted
to be, on grounds both economic and social, highly desirable, yet it is
no less desirable that during those eight hours every working-man in the
country shall, using the best available tools and machinery, and performing
as much labour as he can perform without exerting himself to an extent
prejudicial to his health or inconsistent with his reasonable comfort,
produce as large an output as possible. . .</P>
