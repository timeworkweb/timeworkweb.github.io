<h1>Q Sort Demonstration -- Last Step</h1>
Thank you for completing the virtual Q sort demonstration. Had this been an actual interactive Q sort, the results would have been forwarded to knoW Ware Communications for analysis. You would have been asked to submit your email address if you wanted to receive a copy of the final analysis when it is completed.
