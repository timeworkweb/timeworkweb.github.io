Mr Perot and the anti-NAFTA zealots are wrong in the ways protectionists have always been wrong, as well as in new ways entirely of their own devising (see pages 21-26). Nearly all of these mistakes boil 
down in the end to the most enduring of all economic fallacies: the idea that there is 
only so much output to be produced, or capital to be invested. (Europe is currently 
preoccupied with the "lump of labour" version of this mistake, see page 18.[excerpt 
below])

It sounds fairer to share out a given amount of work evenly. But this begs two 
questions. Is the amount of work given? And how should it be shared out? The quantity 
of work is not fixed: such a notion is known to economists as the "lump-of-labour" 
fallacy. If European labour markets were not jammed by minimum wages and over-
generous social benefits, employment would be higher. Indeed, if shorter hours and 
longer holidays reduced joblessness, Europe would now enjoy the world's lowest 
unemployment. West Europeans work, on average, 10% fewer hours each year than 
Americans, and 20% fewer than the Japanese. Yet the EC's unemployment rate is 
11%, America's 7% and Japan's less than 3%.

Next, some theory. A new machine helps you make more stuff with fewer people. But 
the assumption that this results in fewer jobs rather than more output (and hence more 
goods, and more job-stimulating demand, in a beautifully virtuous circle) is based on 
an economic fallacy known as the "lump of labour": the notion that there is only a 
fixed amount of output (and hence work) to go round. This is clearly wrong. 
Technology creates new demand, either by increasing productivity and hence real 
incomes, or by creating new goods.  
 
<H3>One lump or two?<BR>

Along with these simple "explanations" comes an outpouring of simple "cures": why 
not cut working hours so that there are more jobs to go round, or keep out cheap 
imports or foreign workers? There is a common fallacy at the bottom of both 
explanations and cures. It is that the output of an economy, and hence the amount of 
work available, is fixed. Both history and common sense show that it is not. 
Economists call this the lump of labour (or sometimes the lump of output) fallacy.

Luddism is also commonly linked to the lump-of-labour fallacy in economics, which first-year students are taught to refute and according to which, as the demand for labour is fixed in the short run, labour-saving machinery is bound to "kill jobs''.

An orthodox economist's reply might run something like this: yes, a new machine will 
probably reduce the amount of labour required to produce a given volume of output. 
But to conclude from this that overall employment will decline is to succumb to the 
lump-of-labour fallacy: the long-disproved idea that there is only a fixed amount of 
output (and hence work) to go round. Technology itself boosts output and creates new 
demand, either by increasing productivity and hence real incomes, or by creating new 
products. Video-cassette recorders, mobile phones, Sony Walkmans and soft contact 
lenses barely existed 20 years ago. Such new industries have created new demand and 
new jobs.

The left has said that it will create jobs in France by reducing the working week from 
39 hours to 35. That way, the thinking goes, the available work will be divided 
between more people. This is a classic lump-of-labour fallacy (the idea that there is a 
fixed quantity of work and that if you take a job it is at my expense). In reality, the 
demand for labour changes all the time as a result of productivity and the workings of 
the labour market. For all sorts of reasons a cut in the working week would reduce 
productivity. Thus a policy designed to create jobs would end up destroying them.

It is depressing that supposedly responsible governments continue to pretend to be 
unaware of the old "lump of labour'' fallacy: the illusion that the output of an economy 
and hence the total amount of work available are fixed. In fact the demand for labour 
depends upon productivity and wage costs. Fewer hours will create more jobs only if 
weekly pay is also cut-which workers tend to resist. Moreover, recruitment, training 
and other fixed costs can make it more expensive for a firm to employ a larger 
workforce for shorter hours than a smaller one for longer hours. Worse still, shorter 
hours may reduce a firm's productivity if it becomes more difficult to co-ordinate a 
bigger workforce. Shorter working hours may therefore cause output and jobs to fall.

<H3>Short measure.<BR>

This "cure'' for unemployment is based on the assumption that an economy's output is 
fixed. If this were true, then the amount of labour required would also be fixed, so it 
would seem reasonable enough to share out available work more evenly. Economists 
call this the "lump-of- labour'' fallacy. It is a fallacy because, in reality, the demand 
for labour depends upon labour costs and productivity, which are affected by the hours 
each employee works.
