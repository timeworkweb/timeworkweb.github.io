                <p class="NewTitleDescription">Published in 1821, <i>The Source and Remedy of the National Difficulties</i> was an important influence 
				on Marx's analysis of "disposable time" in a section of his Grundrisse notebooks known as the "fragment on machines." That analysis has 
				inspired rethinking of Marx's mature work by authors ranging from Raniero Panzieri, Antonio Negri, and Paolo Virno to Moishe Postone, yet 
				those re-evaluations do not account for the contribution of the 1821 pamphlet. This article examines the neglect of the pamphlet and offers 
				suggestions about what could be gained by attention to this foundational text.</p>

I would now like to amend that to regard disposable time as the common-pool resource in question. Much of my original rationale applies as well or better to the new formulation.</p>

                <p class="NewTitleAuthor">Review of Social Economy Volume 65, 2007 - Issue 3, Pages 279-291</p> 
                <p class="NewTitleDescription">The lump-of-labor fallacy has been called one of the 'best known fallacies in economics.' It is widely cited in disparagement 
				of policies for reducing the standard hours of work, yet the authenticity of the fallacy claim is questionable, and explanations of it are inconsistent and 
				contradictory. This article discusses recent occurrences of the fallacy claim and investigates anomalies in the claim and its history. S.J. Chapman’s coherent 
				and formerly highly regarded theory of the hours of labor is reviewed, and it is shown how that theory could lend credence to the job-creating potentiality of 
				shorter working time policies. It concludes that substituting a dubious fallacy claim for an authentic economic theory may have obstructed fruitful dialogue about 
				working time and the appropriate policies for regulating it. </p>

                <p class="NewTitleAuthor">Working Time: International trends, theory, and policy perspectives, Edited By Deborah M. Figart, Lonnie Golden, 2001</p> 
                <p class="NewTitleDescription">This chapter examines the sources of the lump-of-labor claim and its role in scholarly and public policy debates regarding work-sharing
				. The character of the lump-of-labor case against work-sharing may be summed up by contrasting mainstream economists' longstanding trepidations toward reducing the 
				hours of work with their usually confident embrace of other labor-saving innovations, such as computers, machinery or power technology. Workable policy and voluntary
				responses to the regime of high fixed costs and long hours of work can be developed, but the stigma of a lump-of-labor fallacy discourages serious consideration of 
				those options by policy makers. The lump-of-labor case against shorter work time emerged as a hodgepodge of borrowed working-class slang, middle-class prejudice and 
				archaic economic doctrine. The claim of a lump-of-labor fallacy is an unwarranted rationalization that obstructs serious discussion of the benefits of shortening 
				work time.</p>

                <p class="NewTitleDescription">A narrative ellipsis… haunts discussion of the problem of social cost and contemporary labour 
				economics in a way that few acknowledged sources could hope to. This ellipsis is not simply an absence of influence but an odd 
				sort of semi-presence that leaves out precisely the most salient details. A. C. Pigou left out explicit credit to S. J. Chapman 
				for his theory of the hours of labour. The Pigouvian tradition, and especially Ronald Coase's critique of that tradition, elided the key 
				part of Pigou's welfare economics that relied on Chapman's theory.</p>

                <p class="NewTitleAuthor">SSRN, 2008</p> 
                <p class="NewTitleDescription">Sydney J. Chapman’s theory of the hours of labour, published in 1909 in <i>The Economic Journal</i>, was acknowledged as authoritative 
				by the leading economists of the day. It provided important insights into the prospects for market rationality with respect to work time arrangements and 
				hinted at a profound immanent critique of economists’ excessive concern with external wealth. Chapman’s theory was consigned to obscurity by mathematical 
				analyses that reverted heedlessly to outdated and naïve assumptions about the connection between hours and output. The centenary of the theory’s publication 
				offers an occasion to reconsider what has been lost by economists’ neglect of Chapman’s theory.</p>

workers for the good object of more free time. Two lessons from that history stand out and bear
reflecting upon. First, a powerful movement for progress can emerge with surprising suddenness

the face of great adversity.</p>

                <p class="NewTitleDescription">The lump-of-labor fallacy's alleged -- albeit unsubstantiated -- assumption of a "fixed amount of work to be done" rewords a staple of 19th century classical political economy, the "certain quantity of work to be done" determined by the number of workers who could be profitably set in motion by a previously-accumulated capital consisting of subsistence goods – a "wages fund." Who did or didn't say "a certain quantity of work" or "a fixed amount of work" is the key evidence for or against the fallacy claim and, consequently, the theodicy claim.</p>
