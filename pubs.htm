                <p class="NewTitleAuthor">Contributions to Political Economy, volume 40</p> 
                <p class="NewTitleDescription">Published in 1821, <i>The Source and Remedy of the National Difficulties</i> was an important influence 
				on Marx's analysis of "disposable time" in a section of his Grundrisse notebooks known as the "fragment on machines." That analysis has 
				inspired rethinking of Marx's mature work by authors ranging from Raniero Panzieri, Antonio Negri, and Paolo Virno to Moishe Postone, yet 
				those re-evaluations do not account for the contribution of the 1821 pamphlet. This article examines the neglect of the pamphlet and offers 
				suggestions about what could be gained by attention to this foundational text.</p>

                <p class="NewTitleDescription">Not only can employment be regarded as yet another common-pool resource among others, but it can also be argued that it is the common pool resource <i>par excellance</i> — the paragon that stands as the single most far-reaching and democratically vital instance of a common-pool resource. Donald Stabile to something in this vein when he noted that "human labor is also the primary constituent of the society whose values must be part of any criterion of social evaluation. The appropriate starting point in any policy directed at social costs is with those imposed on labor."</p>

                <p class="NewTitleAuthor">Review of Social Economy</p> 
                <p class="NewTitleDescription">The lump-of-labor fallacy has been called one of the 'best known fallacies in economics.' It is widely cited in disparagement of policies for reducing the standard hours of work, yet the authenticity of the fallacy claim is questionable, and explanations of it are inconsistent and contradictory. This article discusses recent occurrences of the fallacy claim and investigates anomalies in the claim and its history. S.J. Chapman’s coherent and formerly highly regarded theory of the hours of labor is reviewed, and it is shown how that theory could lend credence to the job-creating potentiality of shorter working time policies. It concludes that substituting a dubious fallacy claim for an authentic economic theory may have obstructed fruitful dialogue about working time and the appropriate policies for regulating it. </p>

                <p class="NewTitleDescription">A common reaction by mainstream economists to the idea of redistributing hours of work is to contend that proposals such as work-sharing, which are intended to spark job growth, are based on the mistaken belief that there is only a fixed amount of work to be done. That assumption is sometimes called the "lump-of-labor fallacy". Alternatively, the notion has been labelled a "lump-of-work" or "lump-of-output" fallacy. The dismissive phrase has become an article of faith among many in the economics profession, despite the fact that advocates of reduced work time have, for more than a century, repeatedly disavowed the alleged belief in a fixed amount of work. </p>

                <p class="NewTitleDescription">A narrative ellipsis… haunts discussion of the problem of social cost and contemporary labour 
				economics in a way that few acknowledged sources could hope to. This ellipsis is not simply an absence of influence but an odd 
				sort of semi-presence that leaves out precisely the most salient details. A. C. Pigou left out explicit credit to S. J. Chapman 
				for his theory of the hours of labour. The Pigouvian tradition, and especially Ronald Coase's critique of that tradition, elided the key 
				part of Pigou's welfare economics that relied on Chapman's theory.</p>

                <p class="NewTitleAuthor">SSRN</p> 
                <p class="NewTitleDescription">Sidney Chapman’s theory of the hours of labour, published in 1909 in The Economic Journal, was acknowledged as authoritative by the leading economists of the day. It provided important insights into the prospects for market rationality with respect to work time arrangements and hinted at a profound immanent critique of economists’ excessive concern with external wealth. Chapman’s theory was consigned to obscurity by mathematical analyses that reverted heedlessly to outdated and naïve assumptions about the connection between hours and output. The centenary of the theory’s publication offers an occasion to reconsider what has been lost by economists’ neglect of Chapman’s theory.</p>
