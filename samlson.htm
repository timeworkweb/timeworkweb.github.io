<H5>The patronizingly tolerant version:</H5>

<H3>The Lump-of-Labor Fallacy</H3>

<P>&quot;We close our analysis of wage theory by examining an important
fallacy that often motivates labor market policies. Whenever unemployment
is high, people often think that the solution lies in spreading existing
work more evenly among the labor force. For example, Europe in the 1990s
suffered extremely high unemployment, and many labor leaders and politicians
suggested that the solution was to reduce the workweek so that the same
number of hours would be worked by all the workers. This view -- that the
amount of work to be done is fixed -- is called the lump-of-labor fallacy.</P>

<P> &quot;To begin with, we note the grain of truth in this viewpoint.
For a particular group of workers, with special skills and stuck in one
region, a reduction in the demand for labor may indeed pose a threat to
their incomes. If wages adjust slowly, these workers may face prolonged
spells of unemployment. The lump-of-labor fallacy may look quite real to
these workers.</P>

<P> &quot;But from the point of view of the economy as a whole, the lump-of-labor
argument implies that there is only so much remunerative work to be done,
and this is indeed a fallacy. A careful examination of economic history
in different countries shows that an increase in labor suply can be accommodated
by higher employment, although that increase may require lower real wages.
Similarly, a decrease in the demand for a particular kind of labor because
of technological shifts in an industry can be adapted to -- lower relative
wages and migration of labor and capital will eventually provide new jobs
for the displaced workers. </P>

<P>&quot;Work is not a lump that must be shared among the potential workers.
Labor market adjustments can adapt to shifts in the supply and demand for
labor through changes in the real wage and through migrations of labor
and capital. Moreover, in the short run, when wages and prices are sticky,
the adjustment process can be lubricated by appropriate macroeconomic policies.&quot;
