<H5>Sidney J. Chapman's 1909 address on the &quot;Hours of Labour&quot;
was considered the &quot;classical statement of the theory of 'hours' in
a free market&quot;, (J.R. Hicks, Theory of Wages, 1932). Then it virtually
vanished from the economics discourse. Why?</H5>

<H2>From S.J. Chapman's Hours of Labour <FONT SIZE=-1>(Economic Journal,
September, 1909, footnote 1, pp. 363-365) new graphs added by Tom Walker,
May 1999.</FONT></H2>

<P>The argument in the more technical parts of this address, concerned
with the determination of the length of the working day, may be conveniently
summarized with the aid of the following figure[s]. In order to avoid the
complexities arising from the redistribution of labour between the industries
of a country, suppose that only one industry exists. Measure units of time
in the working day along <B>OX</B>, and units of money along <B>OY</B>.

Consider first the unbroken lines which represent the influences governing
employers. The curve <B>P</B> expresses the long-period variations with
the length of the working day of the marginal value of a fixed quantity
of labour: the opinion that these can be represented by a curve has been
defended in the body of this address. If <B>O<I>n</I></B> hours are worked,
this daily value of labour and the wage will ultimately be <B>O<I>nda</I></B>;
if <B>O<I>b</I></B> hours are worked, this value and wage rises to <B>O<I>ba</I></B>;
if <B>O<I>e</I></B> hours are worked, it falls to <B>O<I>ba - bef</I></B>.
</P>

<P>The meaning of the curve <B>P</B> will now be plain. The curve is supposed
to rise in the first instance because increasing the daily hours of labour
would at first raise the level of efficiency, and if it did not, the larger
wage would. But<B> P</B> must begin to fall at some point, and eventually
cross <B>OX</B>, as is demonstrated in the body of the address. Actually,
of course, <B>P</B> could not start at <B>OY</B>, because a man when engaged
for only a fraction of his time daily could not live on the proceeds of
his work, but it has been so drawn in the figures to enable us to picture
the value and wage of labour by the area between the curve <B>P</B> and
the co-ordinates.<BR>
<IMG SRC="chapman2.gif" HEIGHT=168 WIDTH=453 ALIGN=BOTTOM> <BR>
The curve <B><I>ck</I></B> represents the immediate variations of the marginal
value of a fixed quantity of labour with the length of the working day
on the assumption that the normal working day has been <B>O<I>b</I></B>.
Hence the value of the normal product of the last minute of the working
day <B>O<I>b</I> </B>is <B><I>bg</I></B>. <I>Ex hypothesi</I> <B>O<I>bgc</I></B>
must equal <B>O<I>ba</I></B>. If the working day is lengthened to <B>O<I>e</I></B>
the product will at first be augmented by <B><I>bekg</I></B>, but finally
by a gradual decline it will sink to <B>O<I>ba-bef</I></B>.<BR>

The influences guiding the operatives are expressed in the dotted lines,
the meaning of which must now be explained. Draw any vertical line <B><I>dl</I></B>
to the left of <B><I>b</I></B>. Then <B><I>dn</I></B> is the addition made
in the long run to the money income of the operative when the <B>O<I>n</I>th</B>
increment of time is added to the working day. Let <B><I>dm</I></B> be
the long-period value to the operative, when his income is <B>O<I>nda</I></B>,
of the leisure destroyed by the addition of the <B>O<I>n</I></B>th increment
of time to the working day. The curve <B>I</B> is the locus of the point
<B><I>m</I></B>. Evidently, starting at <B><I>a</I></B>, it will lie throughout
its length below <B>P</B>, increasingly departing from <B>P</B> (because
leisure is subject to the law of diminishing utility and the value of leisure
rises with income), and cut <B>OX</B> to the left of <B><I>b</I></B>. </P>

<P>Apart from the satisfaction or dissatisfaction of working, therefore,
the far-sighted operative who took into account the value of leisure would
choose a normal day <B>O<I>i</I></B>, which is less than <B>O<I>b</I></B>
(the choice of far-sighted employers in combination). When the normal day
is <B>O<I>i</I></B> the marginal value of leisure to an operative with
a wage <B>O<I>iha</I></B> would be <B><I>ih</I></B>, which equals the long-period
marginal earnings attributable to the <B>O<I>i</I></B>th increment of time
in the working day.</P>

<P> <IMG SRC="chapman4.gif" HEIGHT=196 WIDTH=412 ALIGN=BOTTOM> <BR>
Now, let <B>L</B> indicate the long-period values to the operative of the
effects of different lengths of working day on the absolute satisfaction
or dissatisfaction involved in the labour itself, <B>L</B> being otherwise
interpreted, when units of money are measured along <B>OY'</B> as well
as along <B>OY</B>, and the parts of the curve below <B>OX</B> indicate
the prices which would be paid to escape the dissatisfaction involved in
working, and the parts above <B>OX</B> the money value of the satisfaction
involved in working. As some of the time devoted to production will probably
be pleasant to the operative when the length of the working day is most
favourable to his enjoyment of work, we may assume that<B> L</B> need not
lie throughout its length below <B>OX</B>. Then the working day which perfectly
wise operatives would choose would be <B>O<I>n</I></B>, the point <B><I>n</I></B>
being such that <B><I>nm</I> = <I>nl</I></B>, the attainment of which equation
is the condition under which the operative's satisfaction is maximised.
If, as is theoretically conceivable but practically impossible, <B>L</B>
lay further above <B>OX</B> for the abscissa <B>O<I>b</I></B> than <B>I</B>
lay below it, the length of day most advantageous to the operative would
be greater than <B>O<I>b</I></B>. </P>

<P>If normal hours are <B>O<I>n</I></B>, the operative who lives for the
day and is aware that more work, measured by results, means proportionately
more pay, will obviously desire hours longer than <B>O<I>n</I></B> for
the following reasons. The product attributable to the <B>O<I>n</I></B>th
increment of working time is greater than <B><I>dn</I></B>, since <B><I>dn</I></B>
represents the gain resulting from the <B>O<I>n</I></B>th. less the loss
occasioned by the reduction which will ultimately take place in the productivity
of the operative's earlier hours in consequence of the addition of the
<B>O<I>n</I></B>th increment of time to the working day. For similar reasons
the short-period or immediate value of leisure might be less than <B><I>dm</I></B>.
Again, the money measure of the disutility of the <B>O<I>n</I></B>th increment
of working time is less than <B><I>nl</I></B>, because <B><I>nl</I></B>
measures the results from the fact that the <B>O<I>n</I></B>th increment
of working time diminishes capacity in earlier hours to enjoy labour or
sustain fatigue. </P>

<P>It is evident, therefore, that a balance of gain accrues to the operative
from the work of the <B>O<I>n</I></B>th unit of time, when everything,
including wages is taken into account, but the effect of the work on the
<B>O<I>n</I></B>th unit of time on the gain associated with the rest of
the working day ignored; and, further, that the balance of gain attributable
to the <B>O<I>n</I></B>th hours will not disappear, though it may contract
if the working day be slightly extended. Hence we must conclude that operatives
who are not alive to the reactions of long hours on efficiency and capacity
to enjoy life and work will tend to choose a longer working day than is
wise from their point of view. However, to repeat, they will not approve
such long hours as employers who are equally blind to future reactions,
because the latter, if purely self-interested, make no allowance for the
disutility of labour to the operative or the utility to him of leisure.
</P>

<P>In the event of progress in methods of production the new position of
<B>P</B> would be such that the area enclosed between it and the co-ordinate
axes would be increased. <B>P</B> in its new position might cut <B>OX</B>
at <B><I>b</I></B>, but in all probability the new intersection with <B>OX</B>
would be to the left of<B><I> b</I></B>. It is not likely to fall to the
right of <B><I>b</I></B>, since improvements in the mechanical aids of
labour seldom mean that work is rendered less exhausting. </P>

<P>Even if the new curve <B>P</B> passed through <B><I>b</I></B>, the new
position of <B>I</B> would practically mean its intersection with <B>OX</B>
to the left of <B><I>i</I></B> because of the enhanced value of leisure.
Further <B>L</B>, though it might rise higher than before, would probably
descend sooner and at least as steeply. It is to be observed in addition
that but for interest, rent and heavy depreciation charges, industrial
progress would bring about movements of <B>P</B> involving more considerable
augmentation of the area contained between <B>P</B> and the co-ordinate
axes. </P>

<P>Improved education, apart from its effect on efficiency, would bring
about a subsidence of the curve<B> I</B>, so that in its new position it
would cut <B>OX</B> to the left of <B><I>i</I></B>. The effect wrought
by progress on short-period forces need not be worked out in detail. The
general conclusion is manifest that progress may be expected to be accompanied
by a progressive curtailment of the working day. </P>
