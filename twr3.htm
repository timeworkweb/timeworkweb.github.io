chapter</a>

<dd>"The Work Well Network (Edmonton) is part of a national 
  grassroots organization representing concerned citizens 
  from all walks of life which aims to promote a fairer 
  distribution of labour, leisure and wealth so that all 
  may enjoy a better quality of life including a stronger 
  sense of community. We will do this by:
<ul>
<li>initiating development and implementation of 
alternative work arrangements including job 
 sharing, self employment and reduced work time;
<li>educating the community on the resulting benefits; 
 and 
<li>being a source of information on work-related issues."
