<strong>The following policy proposal was first posted in November 1996.

Howe Institute</a> (April 1997) and the federal government <a href="osberg.htm">Advisory Committee on the Changing Workplace</a> (June 1997). The B.C. government's <a href="accord.htm">Jobs and Timber Accord</a> (June 1997) contains provisions for Alternative Work Arrangements which, in effect, amount to a subsidy to offset the long hours incentive of federal payroll taxes.</strong><p><strong>

</strong></font><hr></center>

When questioned about the prospects for reducing work time and sharing the work, the standard response of business leaders is "<cite>We can't afford it.</cite>" or "<cite>More government regulation? No thanks!</cite>" But what if we could put together a modest, easy-to-implement plan to enable employers to <i>voluntarily</i> reduce their use of overtime and create new jobs at no cost to the employer or the taxpayer? What if all the plan required us to do was to make the federal payroll tax system more fair by closing a tax loophole for overtime? What if the plan was so simple it could be stated in 25 words or less? 
<p>
Here's the plan in "25 words or less": </p><p>
<strong>REMOVE THE CEILING ON THE EMPLOYERS' PORTION OF FEDERAL PAYROLL TAXES (CPP/QPP AND EI). LOWER THE OVERALL RATE TO MAKE THE CHANGE REVENUE NEUTRAL.</strong></p><p>

Under the current system, employers pay no payroll taxes on earnings above $35,400 annually for CPP/QPP and $39,000 for EI.  These payroll tax ceilings undermine the intent of overtime premiums mandated by provincial labour standards. For example, instead of paying "time and a half", employers effectively pay "time and two-fifths" for overtime. The difference is made up by employers' savings on federal payroll taxes --  making overtime a cheaper and more attractive option. 

</p><p>
Thirty thousand (30,000) full time jobs could have been created in 1996 by closing this overtime loophole -- that is, by eliminating the annual income ceilings on employers' payroll tax contributions. (One-seventh of 225,000 = 30,000. This estimate excludes jobs that might have been created by converting "unpaid" overtime into new jobs. An "upper estimate" might assume that as much as 1/3 of all overtime could be converted, creating 125,000 jobs).</p><p>

<strong>BUT...</strong> "Wouldn't changes to payroll taxes amount to a tax grab from middle income earners by the federal government?"</p><p>

<strong>BUT...</strong> "Shouldn't contribution rates to social insurance programs be linked to benefits?" </p><p>

<strong>BUT...</strong> "Not all overtime can be simply converted to new jobs -- there are other costs and considerations involved..."</p><p>
